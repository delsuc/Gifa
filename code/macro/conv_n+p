; conv_n+p
;
; preprocess a n+p experiment;
; i.e. PFG enhanced acquisition, with positive and negative gradients alternated
; and make it States-Haberkorn
;
; Can actually be applied before or after Fourier Transform in F2
;
; see also : ft_n+p ft_sh conv_n+p_onfile

  ; based on an example by H.Demene.
