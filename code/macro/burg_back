; burg_back new_size
;
; extend backward the FID up to new_size, using burg method
; to be used when the beginning of the FID got truncated for some reason.
;
; this is probably not optimum, as burg is phase-minimum
; what we need here is rather a 'phase maximum' method.
; This has the advantage of being MUCH faster than what would be optimum,
; and will work probably just as well, as long as the number of points
; to reconstruct is 'small enough'
