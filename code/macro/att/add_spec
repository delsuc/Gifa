;All the spectra handled by the Assignment module have to be located
;in the special directory spectra/ of the current project.
;The list of the spectra is then handled internally,
;the 'file selector' (located in the project menu) permitting to
;load them or look at them rapidely.
;
;This tool permit to add to the project spectra already located
;elsewhere on your computer.
;This is usually done by creating a soft link to the actual file,
;rather than copying the file.
