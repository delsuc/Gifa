This directory contains all the macros and files for using the assignment
module in Gifa.

The assignment module is accessed by starting it from the menu/Mode entry.

If you have an error message when entering the module, it can be due to
the static database files.
The files topology.*, 3let_1let.* and 1let_3let.* are internal databases.
They should have been installed during the standard Gifa installation.
If they are lacking or cannot be opened correctly, type the command :
build_static_db.g
it should clean and reinstal the static files.
