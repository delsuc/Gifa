;This form is a simple interface, which permits to use most of the
;Gifa features when processing 1D.
;
;It is meant for simple / standard processing. Many other possibilities 
;are available in Gifa, either from the menu entries or from the command line.
;
;You will have to fill several fields, and to execute actions.
;
;The form can remain on screen as long as you wish, you can even have several
;forms opened at the same time, which will execute different processing.
;__________________________________________________________________________
;The entries to fill-in are :
;
;Filename : The file that contains the FID that will be loaded for processing
;
; "info. on data" 
;   Clicking on this button will list on the terminal the content of header
;   of the file.
;
;Flatten solvent : if selected, the macro flat_solvent (see help flat_solvent) will
;   be called before Fourier transform. It permits to flatten strong solvent line
;   if this one is at the zero frequency.
;
;apodisation - F2 apodisation  : the apodisation (window) that will be applied
;   before Fourier transform, along with parameters
;   The available apodisation functions are :
;      sin  - The sine bell       parameter : 0 = pure Cosine,  0.5 = pure Sine
;      sqsin - The squred sine bell 
;      expbroad - exponential broadening   parameter : width in Hz
;      gaussbroad - Gaussian broadening   parameter : width in Hz
;      none
;
;Fourier transform
;   FT type    sim (complex data);  seq (real/tppi data)
;   size after FT (but will be halved if you throw the imaginaries)
;
;Bruker Digital filter
;   if on, the correction for Bruker digital filter will be applied.
;   the needed parameters will be found in the header of the file
;   if they are missing (files imported before the 4.4 version) they will be searched
;   in the bruker parameer files (acqu or acqus) that should be kept in the same directory
;
; Phasing parameters
;   Enter here the phase corrections which should be determined independently
;   Use Find phase to determine phase correction.
;      The phase thus found will be added to the current phase parameters
;   The "Automatic phase corr." button will try to phase for you
;      using an automatic phasing algorithm
;   Use the "Clear" button to reset phase parameters to zero
;
; Baseline correction
;   You can choose to apply automatic baseline correction on both axes,
;   "polynomial" corresponds to 'bcorrp0 bcorr 3'
;   "moving_average" corresponds to 'bcorrp1 bcorr 3'
;   "polynomial+moving_average" or "moving_average+polynomial" correspond to
;	applying both correction one after the other in the described order.
;   The "Apply b.corr." button will apply the baseline corrections
;      to the data-set currently in memory.
;   Baseline correction requires the imaginary part of the data-set
;   to be thrown away, so the actual size of the data-set will be halved
;   along each axis along which baseline correction is applied.
;   "Just extract real" does not apply any baseline correction, but
;         throw away the Im part. (usefull for smaller resulting data-sets)
;
; "Do it all"
;   Apply all the processing currently defined in the form,
;   actually realises the same that the Apply and ok buttons below
;
; "Write macro"
;   writes a executable macro file which, when executed,
;   realises the same that the current form
;
; "Read macro"
;   load a previously written macro file, and create a pre-loaded form
        ;------------programmer info --------------------------------------------
; easy1D args...
; builds and apply a standard action for 2D processing
;
; args permit to set default values for parameters
; easy1D %% is valid though
