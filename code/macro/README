You will find here the standard set of macros for the Gifa program.
Gifa can perfectly work without this set-up, however most of the
functionnality described in the manual will not work.

They are several subdirectories of interest:

3d/		some additional macros for 3d processing
att/		home of the assignment module
gm/		some (small) utilities, mostly used by the GUI
varian/		some processing macros adapted to Vnmr files
misc/		constains old stuff
