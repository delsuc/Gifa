This dis2cache utility has been written by Georgy Salnikov <sge@tomosoft.nsk.su>
in January 1996.

Here is an extract from his mail :
I've just written a DISNMR-to-GIFA converter. I have called it dis2cach,
analogous to your ux2cach UXNMR converter. The archive I've sent uuencoded
separately contains the sources and makefile, which should be put somewhere
into gifa/util/dis2cache or something like this. The converter translates
1D FIDs and 2D .SERs to the native Gifa format (there is no 3D in DISNMR,
and I mean there is little use to convert DISNMR processed spectra). There
is also a small program disinfo to print a few information about DISNMR
spectra. The spectra to convert should be transfered from ASPECT to Gifa
machine as is, and with -1-th sector, with BINARY KERMIT, or NMRLINK.

Not tested !
