	This program "tape" will read Bruker tape on UNIX machines and
will create a H format file for GIFA.

	The tape should be dumped to a file with the following syntax :

dd if=/dev/name_of_tape_device of=name_of_temp_file ibs=1536  conv=noerror 

You may have to fiddle a little around to find what does work on your machine.

The file is then read with this program.

This program was first written for VAX machine by Bruno Kieffer and
Patrice Koehl from Strasbourg, was then adapted to Alliant/UNIX, using the
random_read fortran extension to acces the file by R.Legoas from
Ecole Polytechnique (Palaiseau) then proted to general UNIX with the cio_lib
file by M.A.Delsuc. This program is being used successfully on SGI machines.
No attempt was made to make it fully portable, you may have to play around
to adapt it to your machine!
