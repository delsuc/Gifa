Cach2xeasy converts Gifa cache format files into Xeasy v.1.2. data 
(spectrum) and parameter files.  The program takes two command line
parameters:

cach2xeasy cache_input_file xeasy_output_file

where "cache_input_file" is a Gifa cache format input file name
and "xeasy_output_file" is a base name for Xeasy data and param files.

The program strips off the Xeasy suffix "3D.16" or "3D.param" if these 
are included in the file name.  If the files already exist, they are
overwritten.

The program cach2xeasy was written by Kalle Gehring, Nov. 1998, based on 
the conversion programs ux2cach.c (by M.A.Delsuc), uxnmr_to_xeasy.c (by 
R.W.Glaser), and spec_interface.c and related programs (by C.Bartels).
The program uses several Gifa "system" calls for reading the cache format 
data and parameters.  These subroutine calls are located in the cache_mad.c 
library.  Two Gifa headers with compiler definitions and data structure 
definitions are also required (cache_mad.h util.h and util_mad.c)  [Note 
that util.h is an empty file.]  All of the code for creating and writing
the Xeasy files is self-contained.  Use the included makefile for compilation.

As of this writing, submatrix block sizes are maintained from Gifa to Xeasy
and Xeasy spectrum references (offsets) use the high field (maximum chemical
shift convention (rather than the center chemical shift.)
