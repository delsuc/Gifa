	This program "nmrlink" will read Bruker file which have accessed 
to the UNIX or VMS machines and through networks with the following path :
from AM machines to PC/MS-DOS through the NMR-link package
and from PC to "normal UNIX machines" through FTP in BINARY mode.

it will then create a H format file for GIFA.

This program has been adapted from the tape program.
This program is being used successfully on SUN, Risc6000 and VMS machines.
No attempt was made to make it fully portable, you may have to play around
to adapt it to your machine!

(hint : Check in the convert subroutine and play around with the bytes.)
