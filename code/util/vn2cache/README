This program converts vnmr files to gifa 'cache' files
This is sometimes needed when processing large (3D) data files
which have to be processed through the cache system.

initial version 28.7.99 by Tara Sprules <tara@bri.nrc.ca>
not fully tested (not on Linux), but it sure works on my SGI !

>Hi,
>	After Kalle asked you about converting varian files to cache
>format and our problems with a very large file, I started working on
>a conversion programme for varian to cache format. After a crash course in
>C programming I've got a working version that I made from lvarian.c and

>the correct axes (as with varian_param), and after finishing
>convert_varian I've had enough programming to last for a few days! 
>	I also included the util_mad.c etc. files that I used to compile
>the programme just in case there are slightly different versions around.

Be carefull when compiling this prgram that you should not use the -O
  option on HP-UX, since, due to a compiler bug, the program then
  does not work anymore.  (a bug in the optimization of reversebyte)

M.A.D.
