Here are some description for the Compilation and machine requirements for
the various ports of Gifa.

gifav4_SGI6.tar.Z - binaries for Silicon Graphics machines, R8000 or higher running IRIX 6.5
     compiled with the standard f77 and cc commands on IRIX 6.5
     options -O -n32 -mips4 -DSGI64
     every thing is dynamically linked.
     Runs very fine on O2 and O200 (not tested on O2000)

    with the 4.2 version of C and F77
    with the -fast -O4 optimisation switches
    the F77 library has been compiled in static.

gifav4_DARWIN.tar.Z - binaries for Macintosh running MacOs X or Darwin.
    compiled on 10.1.1 with the standard Apple development tools
    with -O3 option,
    -faltivec option has been activated (support for G4) but does not seem to be very efficient.
