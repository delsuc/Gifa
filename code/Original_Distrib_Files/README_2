Hello,

You just got the Gifa v4 package. Congratulations.

You will find here :

bin/*		the binaries :
	gifa_tiny	4 different version of Gifa, with
	gifa_small	different memory configurations
	gifa_med
	gifa_big
	ux2cach		the utility which transfers from UXNMR to Gifa
			associated utilities/source are in util/ux2cache

macro/*		all the macros needed to get the complete Gifa environment

test/*		a set of tests. Just go to this directory
		and call the macro TEST within Gifa

util/*		a set of utilities - mostly for getting data-sets out-of those
		strange Bruker machines.

help/*		the files for the on-line help

doc/*		The Gifa manuals, in Postscript and in html (Mosaic) format
	
com/*		some shell scripts used for/by Gifa. Some have to be moved
		into a directory pointed by your $PATH variable.
		For instance /usr/local/bin

data/*		example data files (Big!, you should delete these once you
		are familiar with Gifa)

Makefile	An automatic installation program,
		type make and follow indications

History		all the changes since the prvious versions
Brief_description	A short description of the program
README		generic README
README_2	this file
MACHINE_REQUIREMENTS	Details on which machine runs which version
TODO		wishes for the next features to come.

licence_eng.ps	the english version in postscript
licence_eng.asc	the english version in ascii
license_fra.ps	the french version in postscript
license_fra.asc	the french version in ascii

___________________________________________________________________________

Installation of Gifa should be straightforward using the provided Makefile.

make unpack	will unpack the distribution files.

make verify	will verify that the distribution kit is complete.

make test_gifa	will run a comprehensive test of Gifa.
		it is not completely abnormal that some tests fail, this
		is still a beta version, and some feature are there but not
		fully implemented.
		Type :  exit n    at the end to exit Gifa
make install	will install Gifa on your machine. Installation consists in :
		creating  /usr/local and /usr/local/bin directories
			if not already there
		creating a /usr/local/gifa link which points to the
			location where you put the distribution kit
		putting two versions of Gifa into /usr/local/bin,
			typically gifa_med as gifa
			and       gifa_big as gifab
make Bruker_install
		installs some utilities for getting UX-NMR files

Some remarks

1/ You should get a licence if this is not done yet, please read the README
   file, about getting the licence.

2/ The different versions of Gifa are as follow :
**CHANGED with version 4.3 **

    gifa_tiny  is defined for a maximum of 1 Mega points (1k x 1k  2D)
                takes about 9 Mega of memory (Physical + swap) on the system

    gifa_small    is defined for a maximum of 4 Mega points (2k x 2k  2D)
                takes about 23 Mega of memory (Physical + swap) on the system

    gifa_med    is defined for a maximum of 16 Mega points (4k x 4k  2D; 256 x 256 x 256 in 3D)
                takes about 84 Mega of memory (Physical + swap) on the system

    gifa_big    is defined for a maximum of 64 Mega points (8k x 8k  2D; 256 x 256 x 1k in 3D)
                takes about 320 Mega of memory (Physical + swap) on the system

  This maximum number of points determines the largest data-set that can
  be handle in main memory. It is however always possible to work on larger
  data-sets using the cache memory system.

  The gifa_tiny version is now compiled with a large user variable buffer,
  You can thus use it (as we do) as an application builder

3/ Whenever possible, Gifa is compiled with shared libraries (it is quite big
   already). So the libraries have to be on your machine (mostly X11 and Motif)
   This might be a problem if the version numbers of the libraries do
   not match between yours and ours.
   If this is a big problem, I migh consider compiling also a static library
   version. Ask me.

4/ Do not forget to adapt the 2 shell scripts that are needed to Gifa to 
   print and plot:   gifaplot  and  gifaprint
   They are in com/ and are moved to /usr/local/bin by the installation script.

5/ The list of known bugs is in the KNOWN_BUGS file on the ftp server,
   it has been removed from the distribution because the list tends
   to be growing...

6/ The FAQ is at the end of the manual.

7/ Some manuels tends to be not exactly up to date with the program ! Sorry
