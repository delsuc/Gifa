OPEN file_name
Opens the file called file_name for reading or writing. Writing is 
performed with the FPRINT command. Reading is done through the 
<file_name syntax.
e.g.   read <file_name
	read the file which name is found as the next line of the file 
file_name
set line = <file_name
	set the variable line to the contents of the next line of the 
file file_name
OPENing an already OPENed file will rewind the file to the 
beginning.
