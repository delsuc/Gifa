This context holds the limit for the exponential function used in 
the Gull & Daniel algorithm, as well as in the GIFA algorithm.
A function exp2(x) is used which is
	- equal to exp(x)				if x <= explim
	- equal to exp(explim)*(x+1.0-explim)	if x >  explim
i.e. a linear extension of the exponential function is used fo x > 
explim.
