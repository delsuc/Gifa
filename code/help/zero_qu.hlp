ZERO_QU 0 or 1
	Controls the algorithm for INTEG 2D peak integration. When 
ZERO_QU is 0, normal integration is done, When 1, the amoeba is 
computed one the Absolute value of the data-set, and the integration 
is done over this amoeba in normal mode. Useful when integrating 
NOESY peaks with Zero-Quanta contribution. (Zero-quanta integrates 
to 0)
