RTINV n

Calculate the inverse conjugate of all the polynomial roots, thus 
converting backward and forward polynomial. To be used after a 
backward analysis.
n = 1 : forward roots are inversed, and their inverses are put in 
the backward root array.
n = 2 : backward roots are inversed, and their inverses are put in 
the forward root array.
