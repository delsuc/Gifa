AR->RT n
Solve the prediction-error polynomial, calculated from the 
autoregressive coefficients. This is the third step of the LP-SVD 
method.
n = 1 : forward coefficients are used to extracted forward roots
n = 2 : backward coefficients are used to extracted backward roots
n = 3 : both set of roots are computed
