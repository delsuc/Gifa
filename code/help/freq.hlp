FREQ freq_H1 freq1 { freq2 { freq3 } }

The context FREQ holds the basic frequency of the spectrometer (in 
MHz). freq_H1 is meant to be the basic  frequency of the 
spectrometer (1H freq) and is not used in the program. freq2 (and 
freq1 in 2D) are the freq associated to each dimension (different if 
in heteronuclear mode). Values are in MHz.
