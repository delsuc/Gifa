choose the way the second segmentation is done in BCORR 3. This 
feature is only useful with a polynomial approximation.
0 : without.
1 : interactive.
2 : automatic.
When you choose an interactive second segmentation, you have to 
choose one or several areas with the WINDOW command to allow the 
program to cut the correction in these areas if needed. The 
automatic segmentation uses a window, WINSEGM2, and a threshold, 
LEVELSEGM2.
