LOGA n 	with n>=1

Controls the way the levels are computed in the Contour Plot graphic 
mode.

If LOGA = 1, then the lowest level is ABSMAX/(SCALE*LEVEL), and all 
the levels above are equidistant with the same quantity.

If LOGA >1, the lowest level is the same, but each level is computed 
from the previous one : L(i+1) = L(i)*LOGA; in a exponential manner. 

For instance, LOGA = 2 corresponds to the standard BRUKER output.
