JMULT J1 {J2) k
Set up the J (J1 and J2) constant for J-deconvolution; the J entered 
should be half the J of the coupling you want to deconvoluate. k is 
either A or P if you want Antiphase or Inphase J-deconvolution. The 
data are actually multiplied by the filter function. Used mostly to 
check the effect of the filter one the Data.
DO NOT use JMULT before launching a J-deconvolution Maximum Entropy 
run.
