TIMER 0/1

When this context is set to 1, then the time needed to execute each 
command is given. If the command TIMER 1 is given while the value of 
timer is already 1, the timing is issued, and the clock reseted to 
0. Within macros, only the overall execution time of the macro is 
given, unless an explicit TIMER 1 or TIMER 0 is given.
