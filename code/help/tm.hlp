 TM n1 n2 {Fx}
	This commands applies a trapezoid filter function to the data-
set. The function raises from 0.0 to 1.0 from the first point to 
point n1. The function then stays to 1.0 until point n2, from which 
it goes down to 0.0 at the last point.
If in 2D or 3D then Fx tells on which axis to apply the filter.
