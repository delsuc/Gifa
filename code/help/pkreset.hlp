This command recompute peak intensities from the current data set 
and the current peak table, giving results equivalent to PEAK. 
Usefull when either the data-set or the peak table has changed. Note 
that PKREAD reads in the whole peak table, including intensities, 
thus PKRESET permits to recompute intensities form a stored table.
