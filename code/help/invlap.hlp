INVLAP size

Realizes the inverse Laplace transform of the current data-set, considered as 
regularly sampling the time domain with a sampling rate SPECW.  The 
transform is computed for 'size' data-points spanning the range DMIN-DMAX 
in a logarithmic manner. The inversion is performed by MaxEnt iteration.
