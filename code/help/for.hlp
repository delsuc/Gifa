FOR var = n TO p { STEP k }
... GIFA commands
ENDFOR

Control structure permitting to loop over a set of commands. The 
variable var will be created if does not yet exist. By default of 
STEP is 1, but any value can be used (including negative values in 
which case n should be larger than p). n, p and k should always be 
integer numbers.

FOR and ENDFOR should appear alone on one line, eventually followed 
by a comment.
