Used in the BCORR 3 module, to choose the way the baseline is 
estimated.
0 : with ITERMA2 times a moving average filtering on a window of
 size WINMA2.
1 : with a Legendre polynomial approximation of degree DEGRE.
+10 : with a linear interpolation of signal before approximation.
+100 : with an 'elastic effect' that is a rude way to prevent
 from burying the weak lines.
