REAL {axis}

This command extract the real part of the current the data set 
considered as complex.
axis is not needed in 1D, can be F1, F2 or F12 in 2D,
and can be F1, F2, F3, F12, F13, F23, or F123 in 3D

On 2D and 3D you can choose on which axis the REAL operation will be 
taken. Data size can thus be reduced either by 2 , 4 or even 8.
