INVTLAP 
Computes the inverse Laplace transform of the current data-set, considered as 
sampled at the location tabulated in the TAB buffer.  Current data-set 
should have the same number of points than the TAB buffer.  The transform 
is computed for 'size' data-points spanning the range DMIN-DMAX in a 
logarithmic manner.
