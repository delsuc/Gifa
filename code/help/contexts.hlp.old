Contexts are internal Gifa variables that can be easily
accessed in macro programming. They appear as regular
variables, and can be used in any computation just as
regular variables.
Just about all pertinent information (sizes, spectral widths,
last clicked location, etc..) are available through contexts.

Note that context should not be set, but usually are modified with
regular Gifa commands.
eg:      set absmax = 10        ; is wrong
         absmax 10              ; is much better.

Actually, Gifa search for variables in the following order :
-first local user variables
-then global user variables
-CONTEXTS
-finally, currently db bound arrays.

So, if a local or global user variables hapens to have the same name than
a contexts (if you do set absmax = 10 for instance, which creates
a local variable called absmax), then the contexts is not available
anymore.


List of the internal GIFA variables (contexts):

$_      value of the next parameter present on the calling line. CANNOT 
        BE USED WITHIN EVALUATED EXPRESSIONS.
        if the following command is used :

        within the file test, $_ will be 3 the first time and test.001 the 
        second time.
