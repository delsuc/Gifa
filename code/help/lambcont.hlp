LAMBCONT 0/1/2

Tells the Maximum Entropy minimizer which lambda controlling should 
be used.
If LAMBCONT is 0 no controlling is done and Lambda is kept at its 
initial value may be used for hand made lambda control.
If LAMBCONT is 1  lambda is computed such as dQ.dS = 0.0  if conv<1  
(dC dS angle larger than pi/2)
If LAMBCONT is 2  lambda is computed such as cos(dQ,-dC) = 
cos(dQ.dS) if lambcont.eq.2
