DT->SVD size
Calculates the Toeplitz rectangular matrix from the data and perform 
the singular value decomposition. size is the size of data used in 
the formation of Toeplitz matrix. This is the first step of the LP-
SVD spectral analysis method. The same singular value decomposition 
can be used to perform forward and backward analysis.
