DIM n  (n=1 , 2 or 3)

DIM is a context which equals 1 if you are processing one 
dimensional  NMR spectra, 2 if you are processing two dimensional 
spectra and 3 if you are processing three dimensional spectra.
Since 1D 2D and 3D data-sets are kept in different buffers, you can 
switch between this 3 modes freely, keeping the data-sets protected.
