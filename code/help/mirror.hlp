mirror X

implements mirror image reflection, as proposed by Zhu and Bax J.Magn.Reson. 90, p405 (1990)

X determines the position of the t=0 point
X =  0  no shift : in-phase data set
    -1  acquisition started exactly half a dwell after t=0 (will need phase 0 180)
    n>0 acquisition started exactly n dwell before t=0
        Warning, this is not coherent notation
