 calibdosy { sequence nucleus grad_length grad_delay grad_calib grad_shape }

 computes theoretical dfactor from experimental parameters
 for some nucleus (1H, 2H, 13C, 15N, 17O, 19F, 31P)
 When calibration is correct, your DOSY spectra should be directly
 readable in diffusion factors (in micron^2/sec) when using unit d (damping)

 Delays are in seconds, gradients are in Gauss/cm

 Gradient shape can be either :  Square  or  Other shape defined by ascii file

<pre>
 calib_integ  (interactive)

 creates a tool which permits to handle several peaks used for intensity 
 calibration

   This calibration is used to estimate the intensity of the NOESY peaks,
 when building the constraints for a structure generation.
   Choose a set of peaks, spanning the intensities observed on your data-set
 and associate to each peak a 'typical' distance. 
   Then, when building building the constraint file, each peak intensity is compared
 to the set of reference intensities, and a constraint is thus obtained, either
 in a qualit`tive fashion (large / medium / small ) or in a semi quantitative fashion.

 With this tool, you can
  - enter peaks in the calibration list, and associate distance
  - remove defined peaks
  - display the chosen peaks, and drae the calibartion set.
  -  store and load a set of peak definitions (stored as macro commands)

 when loaded, the peak definition are stored in an associative array called
 calib_dst[]

<pre>
Contexts are internal Gifa variables that can be easily
accessed in macro programming. They appear as regular
variables, and can be used in any computation just as
regular variables.
Just about all pertinent information (sizes, spectral widths,
last clicked location, etc..) are available through contexts.

Note that contexts should not be set, but usually are modified with
regular Gifa commands.
eg:      set absmax = 10        ; is wrong
         absmax 10              ; is much better.

Actually, Gifa search for variables in the following order :
-first local user variables
-then global user variables
-CONTEXTS
-finally, currently db bound arrays.

So, if a local or global user variables hapens to have the same name than
a context (if you do set absmax = 10 for instance, which creates
a local variable called absmax), then this context is not available
anymore.
i.e. in the present example, the use of  will not make any error
but you will acces the local variable A just created, rather
than the context you wish to access.


List of the internal GIFA variables (contexts):

<pre>
 to correct the ppm/Hz computation in Gifa
 with version &lt; 4.10

 in Gifa version &lt; 4.10 ,  (i.e up to 4.09)
 computation of ppm and Hz is slightly wrong, by a factor (size-1)/size.
 This macro corrects the internal values of specw and offset
 to give a correct computation of ppm and Hz.
 however, ppm definition will shift a little for spectral region at high field.
 so you might want to recalibrate afterward.
 It should be applied only ONCE to a data-set.

 Since it modifies the spectral parameters of the data-set,
 this data-set, if wrote onto a file will be wrong when read with
 a corrected version of Gifa.

 so the following procedure is proposed :
 Do not touch to your files, version 4.10 should be available by sept. 1996
 Rather read your files, and apply correctppm after reading, so that the
 in-memory file is correct. Do not write it back, at least not on file
 you wish to use later on.

 Note also that peak-files are stored in ppm format
 so peak-tables stored in corrected ppm, will be Ok when read with the
 corrected version of Gifa.
 If you have already peak-tables that you wish to keep,
 and you want to correct the ppm values, do the following :
   read file         ; get file
   pkread peaks.old  ; load peaks
   correctppm        ; peaks won't move because they are internally in index !
   pkwrite peaks.new ; store corrected peak values.
 next time you use it
   read file    correctppm   pkread peaks.new   ; is fine
