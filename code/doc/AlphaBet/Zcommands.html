Put the value zero (0.0) in the current buffer. Quite a destructive 
command !

ZEROING value
sets to zero all the data-point wich have an intensity (absolute 
value) below the value. The prompted default value is the noise 
level.
When coupled to a compression utility (compress or gzip), permits to 
store a file in an optimum fashion.
eg : on a standard tocsy on E.Coli thioredoxine 3mM, using gzip
compressed  uncompr. ratio uncompressed_name
  1945574   2101248   7.4% tocsy	
   870750   2101248  58.5% tocsy1
   149825   2101248  92.8% tocsy2

tocsy	standard file
tocsy1	after ZEROING $noise ; barely visible
tocsy2	after ZEROING (3*$noise) ; more drastic, but all peaks are 
still there

ZERO_QU 0 or 1
	Controls the algorithm for INTEG 2D peak integration. When 
ZERO_QU is 0, normal integration is done, When 1, the amoeba is 
computed one the Absolute value of the data-set, and the integration 
is done over this amoeba in normal mode. Useful when integrating 
NOESY peaks with Zero-Quanta contribution. (Zero-quanta integrates 
to 0)

ZM 1 / 0

Creates / closes  (1 / 0) the graphic box that permits to control interactively
the value of SCALE and the zoom state.

The ZM 1 command will recompute the display in the vignette if the zoom box is
already opened.

The zoom box contains several controls which permits to
-move the zoom area (arrows and by moving the square in the vignette area)
-zoom in and out
-REFRESH button redraws the spectrum
-RESET resets all graphic controls to default values
-switch between the 1D / 2D and 3D working buffers

The ZM box also displays the coordinate of the cursor when a 
button is depressed, the unit used for display depends on UNIT

znot value
This context holds the focal length that will be used for computing 
a 3D display with the DISP3D/REF3D set of commands. A large value 
(1000) will produce a nearly orthometric projection, a small value 
(10 or less) will result in large conic distortions.

ZOOM n f_low f_up  (1D) or  f1_low f2_low f1_up f2_up  (2D) 
    or  f1_low f2_low f3_low f1_up f2_up f3_up (3D)

The basic command for defining zoom windows
(used mostly in macros)

See ZM for information on interactive zooming

if n=0, zoom mode is off.
if n=1, zoom mode is on, you are then prompted for the coordinates 
(row,col) of the lower left point and upper right point for defining 
the 2D zoom window.

In 1D, you are only prompted for left and right borders. 
If a region was already selected on the display with the POINT 
command, this region is proposed as the default region.

To zoom in the display, simply click on the graphic window with 
the left and middle buttons pressed (or Shift + left button),
and draw a rectangle on the display. You can redraw as many time
as wished this rectangle. To zoom into the selected region,
simply click in this rectangle with the left and right button
of the mouse (or Shift + right buttons).
You can also use the Zoom in and Zoom out buttons in the control box.

      Summary
      -------
		Mouse		Shift +
Action		Buttons		Buttons
-----------------------------------------
Draw Selection	left + middle	left
Zoom in		left+right		right
Zoom out		middle+right	middle

To move the zoom window around, you can use the box which appears
in the small vignette at the bottom of the Zoom box.
The eight little arrows can be used also to move around the zoom 
region. Each arrow will move the selected region by half the size of 
the zoom box. The ZM 1 command will recompute the display in the vignette

There are five controls to adjust the vertical scale used for 
displaying the spectra. The Reset button will reset the display to 
the default, (ABSMAX 0 SCALE 1 ZOOM 0) where the largest peak in the 
screen in full size. The four other buttons permit to modify the 
scale value, raising or lowering the SCALE context by factor of 2 
and of 1.2.

The zoom box also displays the coordinate of the cursor when a 
button is depressed, the unit used for display depends on UNIT
