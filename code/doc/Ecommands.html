This form is a simple interface, which permits to use most of the
Gifa features when processing 1D.

It is meant for simple / standard processing. Many other possibilities 
are available in Gifa, either from the menu entries or from the command line.

You will have to fill several fields, and to execute actions.

The form can remain on screen as long as you wish, you can even have several
forms opened at the same time, which will execute different processing.
__________________________________________________________________________
The entries to fill-in are :

Filename : The file that contains the FID that will be loaded for processing

 "info. on data" 
   Clicking on this button will list on the terminal the content of header
   of the file.

Flatten solvent : if selected, the macro flat_solvent (see help flat_solvent) will
   be called before Fourier transform. It permits to flatten strong solvent line
   if this one is at the zero frequency.

apodisation - F2 apodisation  : the apodisation (window) that will be applied
   before Fourier transform, along with parameters
   The available apodisation functions are :
      sin  - The sine bell       parameter : 0 = pure Cosine,  0.5 = pure Sine
      sqsin - The squred sine bell 
      expbroad - exponential broadening   parameter : width in Hz
      gaussbroad - Gaussian broadening   parameter : width in Hz
      none

Fourier transform
   FT type    sim (complex data);  seq (real/tppi data)
   size after FT (but will be halved if you throw the imaginaries)

Bruker Digital filter
   if on, the correction for Bruker digital filter will be applied.
   the needed parameters will be found in the header of the file
   if they are missing (files imported before the 4.4 version) they will be searched
   in the bruker parameer files (acqu or acqus) that should be kept in the same directory

 Phasing parameters
   Enter here the phase corrections which should be determined independently
   Use Find phase to determine phase correction.
      The phase thus found will be added to the current phase parameters
   The "Automatic phase corr." button will try to phase for you
      using an automatic phasing algorithm
   Use the "Clear" button to reset phase parameters to zero

 Baseline correction
   You can choose to apply automatic baseline correction on both axes,
   "polynomial" corresponds to 'bcorrp0 bcorr 3'
   "moving_average" corresponds to 'bcorrp1 bcorr 3'
   "polynomial+moving_average" or "moving_average+polynomial" correspond to
	applying both correction one after the other in the described order.
   The "Apply b.corr." button will apply the baseline corrections
      to the data-set currently in memory.
   Baseline correction requires the imaginary part of the data-set
   to be thrown away, so the actual size of the data-set will be halved
   along each axis along which baseline correction is applied.
   "Just extract real" does not apply any baseline correction, but
         throw away the Im part. (usefull for smaller resulting data-sets)

 "Do it all"
   Apply all the processing currently defined in the form,
   actually realises the same that the Apply and ok buttons below

 "Write macro"
   writes a executable macro file which, when executed,
   realises the same that the current form

 "Read macro"
   load a previously written macro file, and create a pre-loaded form

 "info. on data" 
   Clicking on this button will list on the terminal the content of header
   of the file.

1st point correction : if 'yes' is selected, will perform the macro correct1st
   which correct the first row of the 2D. Should probably always be on

Flatten solvent : if selected, the macro flat_solvent (see help flat_solvent) will
   be called before Fourier transform. It permits to flatten strong solvent line
   if this one is at the zero frequency.

F1 apodisation - F2 apodisation  : the apodisation (window) that will be applied
   before Fourier transform along each axis, along with parameters
   The available apodisation functions are :

   points to add. Uses the burg2d_back macro to reconstruct using Linear Prediction

F1 transform
   FT type    sh (States Haberkorn) - tppi - sh_tppi - phase modu - n+p (echo antiecho)
   size after FT
      (but will be halved if you throw the imaginaries or do a baseline correction)

This form is a simple interface, which permits to use most of the
Gifa features when processing 3D.

Simply give   the input and output filename
              processing and axis to process for each pass
                  (use -none- if 1 pass is enough)
              -write macro- can be used 

It is based on the proc3d macro which permits to apply a given
macro processing on all the plane of a 3D file, the present macro simply
helps in the process of building the various macros used for proc3d.

A typical processing consists in setting up a 2D processing for all
the planes of the 3D, along a given axis, then to set_up for 1D processing
for the remaining axis.

To get things set-up, select the axis, then use the
-practice- button. This will create a dummy 2D file extracted from
the 3D, and which can be used for testing a given processing. You will be
provided with easy2d form to test things up.

When you have found a correct processing, store the macro (with -write macro-
on the easy2d form), and get back to easy3d form.
You will have to click on the - rem. 'read' action - button to remove the
read commande which is in macro written by the easy2d form.

The major difficulty is that you have to process all 3 axes with two 2D 
passes, and things get a little confuse.
To do so, you can typically do the following:
1) practice on 1st pass on F1 planes, and find correct parameters for F1 and F2 
   of F1 planes (thus F2 and F3 of the 3D)
2) store parameters as a macro and close easy2d form
3) click on   rem. 'read' action  for 1st pass
4) Then practice on 2nd pass on F2 planes. Propagate the parameters you 
   have found in 1st pass in F2 to current F2 (it is the same F3 axis of the 
   3D) and find correct parameters for F1
5) DO NOT store these parameters as is, otherwise F3 of the 3D would
   be processed twice !
   Rather, change FT type in F2 to "none" in easy2d form before storing the 
   macro. 
6) click on   rem. 'read' action  for 2nd pass
7) Now you have setted-up two macros, the first one (probably called 
   plane_F1.g) for processing F1 planes (thus F3 and F2 of the 3D), the second 
   one (probably called plane_F2.g) for processing F2 planes, but onbly along 
   the F1 axis of the 3D.

Note that there is no need to process everything at once, may want to do
a partial processing, keep the intermediate file, and use it latter on
to finish the 3D processing.

 easyplot 

 This tool is a simple interface to preview and realize  plots. 
 
 After choosing the plot parameters, you can visualize the current
 spectrum (in a postscript format) with the 'preview' button before drawing
 the current spectrum on a output file (postscript or HPGL).
 You can superimpose several spectra (with different offset) on the same 
 output file.
 The resulting output file can then be visualized, printed or cancelled.
 
	'Page Set-up'
 The page orientation can be in a landscape format (rotation off) or 
 in a portrait format (rotation on). The 'parameters' button permits
 to activate the form box used to modify the contour parameters.
 The plot offset values are used to offset the origin of the plot
 (the lower left corner) at (x,y). The plot size can also be modified.

	'Color Set-up'
 The plot can be :	- 'Monochrome' with a specified color (black, red, 
 yellow, green, cian, blue, purple or white), 
		- 'Bicolor' with the positive signals in blue and 
 the negative ones in red,
		- 'Multicolor'.
 For the postscript format, the line style can be modified.

	'Axes Set-up'
 Along the X and/or Y axes, projections or diagonal can be added.
 The unit along X and Y axes can be in ppm, hz, index, damping or none.
 The tick space can be choosed except for damping unit wich was
 automatically calculated. A grid can also be added.

 You can also give a title to your plot.

This context holds the limit for the exponential function used in 
the Gull &amp; Daniel algorithm, as well as in the GIFA algorithm.
A function exp2(x) is used which is
	- equal to exp(x)				if x &lt;= explim
	- equal to exp(explim)*(x+1.0-explim)	if x &gt;  explim
i.e. a linear extension of the exponential function is used fo x &gt; 
explim.
