<h2>
<a name="Heading1392"></a><i><u>Introduction to the cache system</u></i></h2>
<div>	Up to now we have only seen how the processing was performed on the
data-set currently held into the main memory. This way of working is fast and
efficient for small data-sets, but inefficient for large data-sets. So a
capability has been put into the Gifa program to work on file rather than on
memory. It is thus possible to process much larger data-set, that would not fit
into the main memory.	<br>This is performed through a cache-memory system that
is implemented into the Gifa program. This features has the double advantage of
permitting the processing of very large data-set (no limitation in size, as far
as the software is concerned), and to speed-up the processing of the processing
of large data-sets that can be done otherwise in-memory.	<br>With Gifa V4.0 the
cache system has been fully rewritten, in order to extend its capabilities, and
reliability. Most of the limitations that were in the previous version of the
cache have been removed. You should also notice a large speed increase when
working on large files. However, the user interface has been kept as much as
possible unchanged, except for the <tt><font face="Courier">GETC</font></tt> and
<tt><font face="Courier">PUTC</font></tt> commands which have now a syntax more
similar to other Gifa syntax.<br></div>
