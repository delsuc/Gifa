<H3><A NAME="Heading1643"></A><B>Q : I get the message - Licence is
NON-VALID - ?</B></H3>
<P>Guess what, your licence is not valid! If you already registered, then check 
  again the installation procedure. If you are not registered, just contact me 
  ( <A HREF="mailto:Marc-Andre.Delsuc@cbs.univ-montp1.fr" TARGET="_top">Marc-Andre.Delsuc@cbs.univ-montp1.fr</A> 
  ) I will ask you to sign a licence agreement, and you will get a licence key.</P>
<H3><A NAME="Heading1645"></A><B>Q : I get the message - No graphic
possible - ?</B></H3>
<P>You did not connect correctly to an X-server display. Gifa is
perfectly able to run without X-window, but obviously, all the
graphic commands won't work. In the case described here, the standard
startup.g macro stops when trying to set-up the graphic environment.
To set-up the X-window environment, do (in csh) :<BR>setenv DISPLAY
the_name_of_your_X-terminal:0.0<BR>if you use a remote work-station
for displaying, check that you enabled the remote display by doing
:<BR>xhost +.<BR>To work in graphic-less mode, create your own
startup.g (in HOME/macro or in local directory (.)) which will take
precedence over the general startup.g.</P>
<H3><A NAME="Heading1651"></A><B>Q : Gifa starts correctly but menu
nor graphic window show up ?</B></H3>
<P>If it does not complains about no graphic available, but that
actually no spectral window nor menu show up, it is most probably
that the standard environment is not available. Gifa is such that it
relies a full set of files to perform correctly. These files should
be located in the standard place: /usr/local/gifa. If there are
absent, check your installation, it could be due to the fact that
your forgot to download the gifa_basic.tar.Z archive.</P>
<H3><A NAME="Heading1653"></A><B>Q : I get the message - Killed - and
Gifa does not start ?</B></H3>
<P>This is a typical message when the available memory on the machine
is not sufficient to handle a big program. Try -to use a smaller
version of Gifa (There should be 3 sizes on the distribution kit),
-to extend the swap area of your machine.</P>
<H3><A NAME="Heading1655"></A><B>Q : I get the message - Cannot open
the gifa.log file - ?</B></H3>
<P>This message means that Gifa could not create the gifa.log
journaling file in your $HOME directory. When running, Gifa copy all
the commands to this file. This file permits to redo a processing, or
to find the result of a previous one. When exiting, you are asked for
keeping or removing that file.<BR>Gifa cannot create the journaling
file in several cases : 
</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">a gifa.log file is already present
	in your HOME. This happens when you choose to keep the file when
	exiting, if a gifa is already running for the same account, or if a
	previous run of gifa exited with a crash. 
	</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">the disk is full, or your quota is
	exhausted 
	</P>
	<LI><P>the environment variable $HOME is not defined, or miss
	assigned, (happens when using su ).</P>
</UL>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<H3><A NAME="Heading1661"></A><B>Q : How do I compare spectra in
absolute display scales</B></H3>
<P>Each spectrum in Gifa is displayed relative to its larger point,
the parameter SCALE describes how this larger point will appear on
screen, SCALE = 1 means that the larger point will be full screen. To
make absolute display (and plots) you need to force the program to
scale to the same larger point for display. The value of the larger
point is called ABSMAX. when the data are changed, or when set to 0,
it is recomputed as the largest point in the data-set. But you can
change it by setting its value to any non-null positive value. Thus
using the same ABSMAX for 2 different data-sets will result in
absolute display.</P>
<H3><A NAME="Heading1663"></A><B>Q : How do I set a plot level
relative to the noise level?</B></H3>
<P>Often one wishes in 2D, to have the lower plot level set relative
to the noise level (the 3 sigma case). The noise level can be
computed with the EVALN command. Then the simpler is to put ABSMAX to
the value of the noise (thus telling Gifa that the larger point is at
the noise level (a bit strange I agree)), then to set SCALE reminding
that the lowest level is 32 times lower that the higher level.<BR>Thus,
if you want a 3 sigma plot :<BR><BR><TT><FONT FACE="Courier">EVALN x
y z t ; evaluate the noise</FONT></TT><BR><TT><FONT FACE="Courier">absmax
$noise ; set absmax to the noise</FONT></TT><BR><TT><FONT FACE="Courier">scale
(1/(3*32)) ; set scale</FONT></TT></P>
<H3><A NAME="Heading1671"></A><B>Q : Why are spectra completely
shifted in super1d/super2d</B></H3>
<P>Those 2 macros are based on the SHOWC command which works in ppm
coordinates. Thus to be able to superpose spectra, you should have
correctly calibrated all your spectra. Note also that an earlier bug
in ux2cach was making Gifa files with all spectral parameters wrong
(before version 4.05b).</P>
<H3><A NAME="Heading1673"></A><B>Q : How do I transfer data from my
spectrometer to Gifa ?</B></H3>
<P>There are several answers to this question, which depend on the
kind of spectrometer you use and the nature of the link.</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P><U>Varian</U></P>
</UL>
<P>No problem there, there is a READV command in Gifa to access
directly the Varian files, there is even a set of macros to extract
spectral parameters from the <TT><FONT FACE="Courier">procpar</FONT></TT>
file : <TT><FONT FACE="Courier">varian_param</FONT></TT>; and to give
a graphic user interface to it : <TT><FONT FACE="Courier">varian_read.
</FONT></TT>You can switch to Varian mode to have these as ypour
standard GUI.</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P><U>Bruker DMX - AMX</U></P>
</UL>
<P>Use the ux2cach utility (in gifa/util/ux2cache) which convert
UXNMR data files (not the pdata) into native Gifa files.</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P><U>Bruker AM/WM</U></P>
</UL>
<P>This is always a problem, because of the difficulty to get out of
the Aspect computer. An additional problem is that the Aspect
computer stores data on 24bits, instead of the 32 bits modern
computers use. Some utilities are given here, but expect to have some
tuning to do because of the numerous options available.</P>
<H5><A NAME="Heading1682"></A><I><U>using NMRLink</U></I></H5>
<P>Try to use the nmrlink program, the source is in util/moul4</P>

<H5><A NAME="Heading1686"></A><I><U>using Lightnet transfer</U></I></H5>
<P>Try to use the transdata; program, the source is in util/moul3</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P><U>Other cases</U></P>
</UL>
<P>There are several possibilities :<BR>&yen; The simplest way is to
write Ascii files, and load them with the READT or READM command. Use
the WRITET / WRITEM command to get an example of the correct format
(most parameters are optional).<BR>&yen; If you use MATLAB, there is
a READM command for you.<BR>&yen; You can look into the
gifa/util/ux2cache where you will find the library for accessing the
native Gifa file format, and the source of the utility which converts
UXNMR files into native files (Again, most parameters are optional).
There is also the older gifa/util/ux2gifa utility which converts into
the FTNMR compatible format (the READH command) which is somewhat
simpler to implement, but much less powerful.</P>
<H3><A NAME="Heading1693"></A><B>Q : I am a Varian user, but the FT
seems to be tuned to Bruker - ?</B></H3>
<P>You are actually right, the program is currently developed in a
group equipped exclusively with Bruker machines so far. But, bear
with me, you are not out of luck. You have noticed that the
possibility to read Varian files is implemented in the menu
interface, what about the processing ?<BR>A complete set of macros
are available in /usr/local/gifa/macro/varian which realizes the
equivalent of the standard processing, but for Varian
data-sets.<BR>Simply choose the Varian mode in the mode menu, better
yet, put the following line into your startup.g file, And you start
directly in Varian mode..<BR><TT><FONT FACE="Courier">SETPATH
('/usr/local/gifa/macro/varian' ; $GIFAPATH)</FONT></TT></P>
<H3><A NAME="Heading1699"></A><B>Q : I get the message - Size too big
for operation - ?</B></H3>
<P>with the bcorr 3 commands for instance.<BR>These command use
alternate buffers which are not available because of the size of the
current data-set. You can : i) choose a bigger version of the program
(there should be three in the distribution) memory allocation is
static in Gifa. ii) choose another algorithm. For instance remember
that<BR><TT><FONT FACE="Courier">chsize (%*2) ft phase x y
real</FONT></TT><BR>and<BR><TT><FONT FACE="Courier">ft phase x y ift
ftbis</FONT></TT><BR>give the same data, however the second method
requires twice as small buffers.</P>
<H3><A NAME="Heading1706"></A><B>Q : What is the - Overflow xxx
buffer - message ?</B></H3>
<P>Gifa handles the data in several buffers that overlap (see
&quot;UNDERSTANDING MEMORY SET-UP&quot;). when the data gets too big
some of the less needed buffers are used for handling the data. Thus
certain operations becomes not available. See precedent Question.</P>
<H3><A NAME="Heading1708"></A><B>Q : Why am I sometimes prompted for
the overflow and sometimes not ?</B></H3>
<P>When a buffer is going to be overflowed by the current command,
and when the command is issued from the main level (from the prompt
or from a menu/form) then you (the user) are asked if it is OK to
overflow. The command is aborted if you answer no. This question is
not asked when the command which creates this overflow is issued from
within a macro. This permits to write macro that will always work. If
you want to protect from within a macro, you should make the test in
the macro.</P>
<H3><A NAME="Heading1710"></A><B>Q : My spectra show up completely
scrambled after FT ?</B></H3>
<P>There several data format possible for NMR : in 1D, data can be real, complex, 
  or acquired in the sequential &quot;Redfield trick&quot; mode. in 2D and 3D, 
  data can be in tppi, in States-Haberkorn, in gradient N+P interleaved, in phase-modulation 
  modes, or even in a mixture of these. Complex parts can be interleaved or separated, 
  there are different conventions on the sign of the imaginary parts; etc... etc...<BR>
  There is a set of macro which has been designed to deal with this problem : 
  ft_sim and ft_seq (for 1D or acquisition dim processing) ft_tppi ft_sim and 
  ft_sh_tppi for nD. These macros work without problems for Bruker/UXNMR spectra, 
  however they might need some tuning for another set-up.<BR>
  These macros are built from simple commands, there are many possibilities in 
  Gifa, try to play with FT RFT FTBIS; REVF INVF REVERSE; SWA USWA. Once you have 
  found a set-up, you might want to propagate it in the macros ft_* found in the 
  distribution.</P>
<H3><A NAME="Heading1736"></A><B>Q : What is the analytical counter
part of the SIN command ?</B></H3>
<P>the exact definition of the SIN command is :<BR>with the parameter
X [0.0 0.5] and N points to process<BR>s = 2*(1-x)<BR>w =
PI/((N-1)*s)<BR>phi = PI*(s-1)/s<BR>after the <B>SIN x</B> command,
the ith point of the current buffer is multiplied by :<BR>SIN(i) =
sin( (i-1)*w + phi ) with i : 1..N</P>
<H3><A NAME="Heading1744"></A><B>Q : What is the analytical counter
part of the GM command ?</B></H3>
<P>the exact definition of the GM command is :<BR>with the parameter
GB, N points to process, a spectral width of SW<BR>Z = ( (GB*PI) /
(4*SW*SQRT(LOG(2))) )^2<BR>after the <B>GM GB</B> command, the ith
point of the current buffer is multiplied by :<BR>GM(i) = exp(
-Z*(i-1)^2 ) with i : 1..N</P>
<H3><A NAME="Heading1750"></A><B>Q : How does SIN or GM relate to
Bruker equivalent ?</B></H3>
<P>Or actually the opposite, how can I keep SIN or GM equivalent to
the Bruker manner?<BR>Indeed the definition of the parameters are
VERY different.<BR>Well, first you should forget Bruker, but then, if
you are really addicted, you may try the <TT><FONT FACE="Courier">sin_bruker</FONT></TT>
macro which implements the Bruker SIN/SSB command; and the <TT><FONT FACE="Courier">gm_bruker</FONT></TT>
macro which does the Bruker GM command. You may also look into the
macro code to see what are the analytical to transform from Bruker to
Gifa.</P>
<H3><A NAME="Heading1754"></A><B>Q : How can I start Gifa in
background job ?</B></H3>
<P>Check on the writtin macro documentation.</P>
<H3><A NAME="Heading1756"></A><B>Q : Plot does not work</B></H3>
<P>Gifa builds plots by adding to a file the different graphics to be
plotted. The command PAGE has the effect of closing the plot_file
(equivalent to FORGET) and to send the plot_file to the plotter with
the shell script 'gifaplot'. This shell script is copied into
/usr/local/bin at installation (check that it is in your PATH), and
should be adapted to your particular set-up. A very common reason why
plots do not work is either that the shell script has not been
adapted. This shell script is called with 2 parameters : the name of
the plot_file; the type of plotter (HPGL or postscript). As sent, it
is configured to use lpr, and to remove the file if it is called
Gifa_Temp.Plot. Another reason is when for some reason the internal
memory of plot-files, and the state on disk are different (for
instance if a write fails, or if CD is used), in this case, remove
the corrupted file, and use FORGET to clear the internal counter
part.</P>
<H3><A NAME="Heading1758"></A><B>Q : set si1_2d = 2048 does not work</B></H3>
<P>Gifa internal variables are sometimes a bit confusing. They look
like user variables when you fetch them, however you cannot write
into them. In the case of the question above, $si1_2d has to be
changed with CHSIZE. Actually, the command :<BR><TT><FONT FACE="Courier">set
si1_2d = 2048 </FONT></TT><BR>creates a user variable, with the
(unfortunate) name si1_2d, which will 'hide' the internal variable.
Next time, when you will evaluate $si1_2d, you will get the value of
your user variable (in this case 2048), not the size of the current
2D, which is no more available.</P>
<H3><A NAME="Heading1762"></A><B>Q : SH just returns, and do nothing</B></H3>
<P>This happens when the memory is very loaded on the machine, and
that the fork() call fails. Try to : remove useless processes; use a
smaller version of Gifa; expand the swap area (or the physical
memory) of your machine.</P>
<H3><A NAME="Heading1764"></A><B>Q : my log file does not go away
when I exit with : exit n</B></H3>
<P>Same as above (the exit n command internally uses the SH
mechanism)</P>
<H3><A NAME="Heading1766"></A><B>Q : What is the Gifa data format</B></H3>
<P>The fundamental file format (READ command) is a bit complicated to
describe, but the library for accessing it is fully available in
util/ux2cache/cache_mad.c in the distribution. This is a library,
which permit all accesses (1D, 2D, 3D), the format is also described.
This code has been made public domain.<BR>There are also data format
which are easier to handle for a small program :<BR>ft-nmr kind or
format (READH); ascii format (READT); matlab format (READM).</P>
<H3><A NAME="Heading1770"></A><B>Q : How can I read Data set as text?</B></H3>
<P>There are several ASCII format input available in Gifa, they
correspond to several READx commands (you have the full list if you
do help write)<BR>READM is a matlab compatible format (-ascii
format). It consists in raw data (without any parameters); numbers
are formatless; 1D is one single line; n (F1) p (F2) 2D is n lines of
p entries.<BR>READT is a generic ascii format; header entries are
available so you can put parameters; numbers are formatless, one per
line, after the (required) keyword <B>data:</B> <BR>n (F1) p (F2) 2D
is nxp lines of 1 entry<BR>load is even more generic, (it is a
macro)<BR>no parameters, one entry (formatless) per line, only for 1D
(slow !)<BR><BR>In any case you never need two columns, entries are
assumed to be sampled regularly, and the SPECW parameter give the
sampling frequency. You can also use the respective WRITEx commands
to see what the input files should look like.</P>
<H3><A NAME="Heading1779"></A><B>Q : Planes displayed from 3D require
very unrealistic scale</B></H3>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">3D processing is usually handled by
on-file processing. There is a bug in the set of command permitting
to realize this (probably in NEWFILEC) which can perturbate the value
of the Absmax parameter of the file (which hold the value of the
largest point, and is used for display). The macro <TT><FONT FACE="Courier">reset_absmax</FONT></TT>
permits to restore the correct Absmax value.</P>
