<H2><A NAME="Heading1396"></A><I><U>Detailed Principle of Operation</U></I></H2>
<P>The cache memory works on the standard file format ( accessed also
through the <TT><FONT FACE="Courier">READ</FONT></TT> / <TT><FONT FACE="Courier">WRITE</FONT></TT>
commands). It is based on two principles : 
</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P>A block structure of 2D and 3D data set files, that permits
	random access of data in any direction,</P>
	<LI><P>A memory area that is devoted to minimising the number of
	disk accesses (the cache-memory system).</P>
</UL>
<P>In the previous version of the cache (Cache version 1.0, in Gifa
3.x and in pre-release of Gifa 4.0), the blocks were of a fixed size
of 4096 words (16 kbytes) corresponding to 16x16x16 in 3D, to 64x64
in 2D and to 4k in 1D. This is no longer true, in the present version
(Cache version 2.0, since Gifa 4.0), the blocks are adapted to the
experiment and to the computer. This means that the block may take
any value, optimised for the current hard-ware (typically 4kbytes and
16 kbytes), and that the division of the blocks will depend on the
sizes of the experiment, in order to optimise access speed in all the
spectroscopic dimensions.</P>
<P>The standard format features also a header which holds all the
parameters of the data (such as dimensionality, sizes, spectral
widths, etc...). This header is in text format, and can easily be
displayed with a more command. The user can easily add his own
information in the header with the <TT><FONT FACE="Courier">GETHEADER</FONT></TT>
<TT><FONT FACE="Courier">PUTHEADER</FONT></TT> commands. The header
is of a fixed size equal to the size of a data block. The cache
system can be used with several files in the same time.</P>
<P>Cache memory access is much faster than a disk access. The block
structure of the file speeds up the processing of large data sets.
For instance to access 2 successive planes of a 3D, the first plane
will be loaded from the disk, and then the second will be
subsequently held into the cache memory. There is no real limitation
of the size that the cache system may handle, however each file
opened with the cache system will use room in the computer memory
allowing to fit several line (plane) of the 2D (3D) experiment. <BR>It
is important to note that writing onto the cache is not equivalent to
writing onto disk. There is some mechanism, that will store on disk
the content of modified block when needed; but the content of the
file is not warranted when working through the cache system (this is
very different from the WRITE command). This has no effect when
working from within Gifa itself, since all file access will go
through the cache system that will insure the coherence of the data.
However it may have effect in certain cases such as : 
</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">the file from another program (may
	be another Gifa); 
	</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">failure of the computer; 
	</P>
	<LI><P>bug in Gifa (?).</P>
</UL>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>When needed, it is possible to
&laquo;&#160;flush&#160;&raquo; the cache and to copy to disk all the
modified blocks with the commands <TT><FONT FACE="Courier">FLUSH</FONT></TT>
and <TT><FONT FACE="Courier">FLUSHCACHE</FONT></TT>. <BR>Processing
data-sets with the cache memory system usually requires using some
macro for scanning through the complete data-set for the operation to
be completed. A set of macros is provided which will permit an
efficient and easy processing (see below).</P>
