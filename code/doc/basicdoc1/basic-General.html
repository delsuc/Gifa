<a name="Heading819"></a><i><u>General set-up</u></i></h2>
<div>	The standard way of working on an NMR spectra with Gifa is to hold
everything in memory. This is in contrast with most NMR programs that process
data on disk files, and permitted by a clever memory management.	<br>So, to
process a data-set with Gifa, you generally load it in memory, do most of your
processing, plot it, and optionally store the processed data on a file for later
processing. This permits a very fast processing on small every-day data-sets.
When a larger data-set necessitates to work on a file, then a set of specialised
commands permits to use all the regular commands on file.	<br>Gifa presents
several buffers to store the data. Three working buffers are available for
respectively 1D, 2D and 3D. These 3 buffers are independent for regular
processing. The buffer on which you are working depends on the value of the
context DIM which takes the value 1, 2 or 3.	<br>All the commands refers to the
current buffer (as selected by DIM). Depending on the value of DIM, some
commands may ask for a varying number of parameters ( 1 per dimensions ) others
may ask for direction, in which case the direction is selected with the syntax
Fx. In 2D : F2 for the acquisition dimension, F1 for the other and F12 for both.
In 3D : F3 for the acquisition dimension, F1 for the slowest dimension, F2 for
the intermediate dimension, and F12, F13, F23 and F123 for combinations. When a
command requires a parameter for each dimension, F1 parameters will be entered
first, then F2 and finally F3 (if in 3D), this rule is general, with the
exception of graphical commands which will ask for X and then Y
parameters.<br></div>
