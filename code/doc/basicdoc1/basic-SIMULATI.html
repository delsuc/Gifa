</u></i></font></h1>
<div>The two commands SIMUNOE and CHEMS permit to generate simulated NOESY
spectrum from intensity computed from the 3D structure of the molecule. First a
list of chemical shifts should be constructed, either directly or with the help
of the CHEMS command. The chemical shift list is a file with one entry per line,
each line holding the name of the atom (in PDB-like format), the chemical shift
in ppm, and the line-width. Then the command SIMUNOE will use this file and a
intensity file constructed with the help of the CORMA program (Keepers &amp;
James J.Magn.Reson. <br>The command generates an output file containing
information on all the peaks in the spectral window. This file is very useful
when searching for the origin of peak seen in the simulated spectrum. For this
purpose, if you specify a null size for the simulation, then no data will be
generated, and the data-set currently held in the memory will not be
over-written, but the output file will be created, thus permitting to generate
peak files for small spectral region.	<br>The commands
<tt><font face="Courier">SIMUNOE</font></tt> and
<tt><font face="Courier">CHEMS</font></tt> used to be needed for the simulation
of NOESY data-sets, however these commands were quite buggy, and have been
superseded by a simple set of macros which realizes the same
thing.	<br><tt><font face="Courier">SimSpect2D</font></tt> is the basic command,
it takes as parameters : first a data-base of all the spins along with their
chemical shift and line width; then a list of intensities in a simple free
format, finally a set of controls, determining the 2D modulation and whether the
data-set is symmetrical or not. This macro will generate a 2D FID, that can be
then processed as a regular data-set. Be careful however, that the process can
be quite lengthy, if you compute a large region, with a lot a peaks and a lot of
points.	<br>The  chemical shift data-base is in dbm format, and can easily be
built from an ascii file with the <tt><font face="Courier">mkdbppm</font></tt>
macro. The intensity file is in ascii, and can have been generated by any
program. For instance, the <i>CROWD</i> program developed in our laboratory can
create NOESY and ROESY simulation from 3D structures and dynamic information.
However the SimSpect2D macro can be used to simulate any kind of 2D
data-sets.	<br>There is an additional macro available :
<tt><font face="Courier">SimSpect2D_form</font></tt> which creates a form
permitting to very simply enter parameters for the
<tt><font face="Courier">SimSpect2D</font></tt> macro.<br><br></div>
