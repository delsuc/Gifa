<a name="Heading1380"></a><i><u>Strip files and Strip plots</u></i></h2>
<div>	A set of macros have been designed to handle strip files. This can be
performed for all kind of 3D, even if examples will be given here for double
resonance experiments.	<br>The principle is to extract strips from the 3D where
you know (from a previous 2D, or from the projection) there is signal, and to
construct from these strips a pseudo 2D data-set. This is done here by using a
2D peak picking for locating strips to be extracted.	<br>Imagine you have a 3D
<sup>1</sup>H-<sup>15</sup>N NOESY-HSQC experiment from which you want to create
the strip file, (say your <sup>1</sup>H dimension are F1 and F3, and the
<sup>15</sup>N dimension is F2), here how you could do.<ul>
<li>Get a nice HSQC plane, by using the adequate projection from the 3D (F1
projection)</li>
<li>go in 2D mode and make a peak-picking of this plane, check with SHOWPEAKS
that all your peaks are there.</li>
<li>if it's not done join your 3D (yes strips work only on JOINed 3D, no big
deal, simply write your memory-located 3D and JOIN it !) and start the
strip_file macro, it prompts you for the axis to strip down (here F1, and the
starting and ending index of the peak in the table to use.</li>
<li>you get a 2D where each entry in the 2D peak table has been projected as a
F1 strip. The spectral width and frequency of the fake F2 dimension have been
adapted so that in ppm unit, you will have the peak index in the 2D peack table
as a ppm coordinate.</li></ul><br>You may prefer to use a real 2D HSQC to make
the peak picking, (with, say, more resolution) the processing is the same, but
simply start with the 2D, and make our peaking. Just be VERY carefull that the
ppm calibration is EXACTLY the same than the 3D, since every thing will be
computed in ppm.<br><br>With the same technique, you can create strip plots with
the strip_plot macro, an additional information to be given is simply the number
of strips per page.<br></div>
