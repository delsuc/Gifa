INTRODUCTION</H1>
<p>	This part of the manual describes the processing DOSY spectra with Gifa.
Two main techniques are available to process DOSY experiment, and, more
generally, to process sums of damped exponentials: the fit of different
components, based on the general fitter available in Gifa; and the inverse
Laplace transform approach, performed here by Maximum Entropy. The mathematical
problem handled here is much more general than the processing of the DOSY
experiments, but includes also any data-sets (such as relaxation measurement
experiments) that can interpreted in terms of exonential decay.<br>
	This manual first present a theoretical introduction, which presents the
principle of the inverse Laplace transform, and how this problem can be solved
using Maximum Entropy; then the user set-up, implemented for DOSY problems, is
presented.
