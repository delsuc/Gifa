THEORY</H1>
<p>Laplace transform is the mathematical operation which relates a decaying
signal with the distribution of dampers which created it.<br>

		eq[1]<br>
In the terms of this manual, G(s) is said to be in the direct space
(experimental data); whereas A(<sub>
<IMG HEIGHT=13 WIDTH=10 SRC="dosy02.GIF"></sub>)
is in the reciprocal space.<br>
When there is only one well-defined dampers, the equation 1 simplifies to<br>
	<sub>
<IMG HEIGHT=17 WIDTH=103 SRC="dosy03.GIF"></sub>
					eq [2]<br>
The general problem consists in determining the damper distribution A(<sub>
<IMG HEIGHT=13 WIDTH=10 SRC="dosy04.GIF"></sub>),
given the measured signal G(s).<br>
In the case where eq [2] is a correct description of the measured signal
(diffusion of monodisperse solutions for instance), Determination of the
parameters (A and <sub>
<IMG HEIGHT=13 WIDTH=10 SRC="dosy05.GIF"></sub>)
can be simply performed by a least-square fit of the signal G(s). When the
equation 1 is to be used (polydisperse solutions), then the Laplace transform
has to be inversed. This is a well-known numerically difficult method, the
whole purpose of this module is to realise this inversion.<br>
The inverse Laplace analysis permits to describe the complete distribution of
dampers A(<sub>
<IMG HEIGHT=13 WIDTH=10 SRC="dosy06.GIF"></sub>)
as used in eq 1. This permits to analyze with the same ease, single exponential
decays (that will appear as a distribution with one single peak , whose width
is related with the accuracy of the estimate), but also sums of exponential
(with no assumption needed on the number of components) or even continuous
distribution.
