<h2>
<A NAME="Heading15">Principle</A></h2>

<p>Usage
of the DOSY module is actually quite simple. First acquire a DOSY experiment
(either 2D or 3D). Then process it in a regular fashion along the spectroscopic
axes (note that you will not be able to use the easy2D module, but will have to
go through the elementary operations yourself). Then estimate the noise in a
signal free region. Preset the various Laplace parameters : <tt>DMIN</tt>,
<tt>DMAX</tt>, TAB buffer, etc... as well as the MaxEnt parameters :
<tt>ITER</tt>, <tt>LAMBSP</tt>, etc... Then start the complete processing
(which can be quite lengthy, even on a fast computer) with <tt>dosy2d</tt> or
<tt>dosy3d</tt>.</p>

<h2>
<A NAME="Heading16">Tips</A></h2>

<ul>
<li>	Be careful to use a very good baseline correction before trying to apply
the inverse Laplace transform. You should not use the polynomial baseline
correction for this purpose, since peak intensity is varying from one row to
the other. Rather use the spline baseline correction.
<li>	You might find a good idea to practice on 2 or 3 typical 1D slices taken
out of the complete experiment.
<li>	Some care must be taken in choosing the <tt>DMIN</tt> <tt>DMAX</tt> range.
It must encompass the range of actual decays observed in the experiment.
However note that <tt>DMIN</tt> and <tt>DMAX</tt> are in the reciprocal unit of
the direct space unit. This means that if you use regularly sampled,
<tt>DMIN</tt> and <tt>DMAX</tt> are in sec-1 (thus related with
<tt>SPECW</tt>), but if you use tabulated values, they are in inverse of the
tabulated values (be carefull with those strange Gradient units). <tt>DMIN</tt>
and <tt>DMAX</tt> determine completely the reciprocal space, <tt>DFACTOR</tt>
is only used when displaying the unit to the user, and has no effect on the
processing.
<li>	You may want to check the range either by generating a fake data-set (eg :
<tt>ZERO</tt> and <tt>SETVAL</tt> to generate a delta function,
<tt>LAPLACE</tt> or <tt>TLAPLACE</tt> to generate direct space data-set), or by
trying directly an inversion with <tt>INVLAP</tt> or <tt>INVTLAP</tt>.
