<P>There is in <I>Gifa</I> a support for the UNIX standard data-base
file format dbm. A dbm data-base is composed of two files:
<TT>base_name.pag</TT> and <TT>base_name.dir</TT> which together hold
the information of the base_name data-base. Each entry consist of a
field indexed with an access key. Each entry is accessed with the
access key. Data can be retrieve, stored, modified in the data-base.
Every operations are realized on the file, but the disk accesses are
minimized.<BR>In <I>Gifa</I>, such a dbm data-base is accessed
through a binding to an associative array. Each entry of the
data-base appears as a element of the array. Reading, storing and
modifying entries is performed by fetching and assigning array
values. The access key of the entry in the dbm file appears as the
index of the associative array, and the content appears as the value
of the associative array. Due to internal <I>Gifa</I> limitation,
only keys up to 31 characters and entries up to 256 characters can be
handled.</P>
<H3><A NAME="Heading30"></A>DBOPEN, DBCLOSE</H3>
<P>These two commands permits to associate the dbm file with a pseudo
internal array variable. The command</P>
<PRE STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.5cm">dbopen array_name file_name</PRE><P>
will associate a pseudo associative array with the dbm files of base
name : <I>file_name. </I>The file is created if it does not exist
yet. No actual variable <I>array_name</I> is created, but each
operation on it is performed on the dbm file.<BR><TT>DBCLOSE</TT>
closes the file and forget about the array <I>array_name</I> .<BR>The
functions <TT>dbm()</TT> and <TT>nextlm()</TT> permits to handle the
dbm file in macro processing. The control <TT>FOREACH</TT> permits to
scan easily through all the entries of a dbm file.<BR>Let's give an
example :</P>
<HR WIDTH=605 ALIGN=CENTER>
<PRE STYLE="margin-left: 1cm; margin-right: 1cm">dbopen array file_db                    ; associates the file 
set array['dim'] = $dim         ; store entries (associative array)
set array['size_1d'] = $si1_1d
dbclose array                           ; and closes the file</PRE>
<HR WIDTH=605 ALIGN=CENTER>
<P>after closing <TT>array[]</TT> is not available anymore (it was
here as a tool to writing into the file <TT>file_db</TT>.<BR>However,
values have been stored into the file, so next time you will <TT>DBOPEN</TT>
it (eventually binding an array with a different name this time),
they will be there again.</P>
<PRE>dbopen next_time file_db
print $next_time['dim']
dbclose next_time </PRE>
