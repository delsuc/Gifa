<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">It is possible to modify and adapt the
user interface within the <I>Gifa</I> program. Actually, the graphic
user interface (GUI) you are used to when using <I>Gifa</I> is
completely built in the macro langage. Everything is built from a
simple set of basic commands which permits to build menus, dialogue
boxes, etc...</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">To write your own user interface, you
should understand first some standard concepts commun to all GUI
environment. There is a quite small number of primitive command for
building GUI element, each refer to quite different type of graphic.
However, each of these command accept a very large range of
parameters. The basic commands are : BUTTONBOX for building menu
bars, DIALOGBOC and FORMBOX for building forms to be filled. All
theese GUI commands handle several piece of data which have to be
differenciated.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">1) Each graphic element (a menu, a
dialog box) has a name, this name is a character string, it usually
appears as the name of the window in which it is displayed. 2) The
GUI elements are designed to create actions from a user generated
event (typically a click), this action is here simply a <I>Gifa</I>
command (what else could it be). This action is called the 'callback'
of the GUI element. 3) The GUI elements are built from a library of
standard widjets. A widjet is that kind of graphic element every user
understand its use when seeing it (an entry in a menu, a pop-up menu,
an entry field, etc...) The kind of widjet available depends on the
kind of GUI comman you are using. 4) The GUI is built by the
execution of a macro, but the callback of the GUI will also execute a
macro. This is knd of confusing the first time, even more if you
thank that tha callback macro can very well build a new GUI
element.... To clear this up a little, we will refer to buildtime
(when interpreting the macro that build the GUI) and to runtime (when
the built GUI calls a macro through the callback technique for
further action)</P>

<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">The command <FONT FACE="Courier">BUTTONBOX</FONT>
creates a new entry in the menu bar. It creates the menu bar if
called for the first time. Parameters of the command are the name of
the menu as it appears in the menu bar, then a list of entries
consisting of the name of the button and the <I>Gifa</I> command
associated to it. The lists end with a *. The special entry <I>separator</I>
does not set a button but a separator in the box.</P>
<P>Any legal command can be used to be associated with a given
button, a built-in command as well as a macro, and will be executed
as if entered form the terminal. So the <FONT FACE="Courier">WHILE,
FOR, IF .. THEN, GOTO</FONT> commands are not available but the <FONT FACE="Courier">IF</FONT>
.. <I>any_command</I> syntax is valid. The action of the command in
independent from the way it is called, except for the user prompting
for values, which is performed with dialogue boxes in the case of a
command called from a button.<BR>Example given :</P>

<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">The first two commands are closely
related.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT FACE="Courier">DIALOGBOX</FONT>
permits to build sophisticated dialogue boxes, several fields can be
built into the dialogue box, that the user has to fill-up. Each filed
is internally associated to a <I>Gifa</I> variable, that the remain
of the macro processes. The command appears as follow :</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT FACE="Courier">DIALOGBOX [series
of entry] *</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Each entry consists of a name, that
appears as such in the dialogue box, and of a type for the field.
Types can be : <B>message, text, string, int, real, file, enum,
multienum, cursor</B>.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><B>message </B>type consists of a
string that is displayed on the form and permits to put text in it.
<B>text</B> permits to display the content of a text file, in a
scrollable sub-window.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">The others type of field are associated
to a variable which can be modified by the user, and can be used in
the following of the macro.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><B>string, int, real </B>and<B> file
</B>have two other entries which give the name of the associated
variable and its default value. These types correspond to editable
fields that the user has to fill-up. <B>string, int, real</B>
correspond to string, real values or integer values respectively;
<B>file</B> corresponds to a file-name entry, and presents a small
additional button in the dialogue box, which permits to pop-up a
standard Motif file selection box.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><B>enum </B>realises a pop-up menu, for
an enumerated choice. It needs an additional entry which described
the list of choice.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><B>multienum</B> uses the same syntax
than enum, but permits a selection within the list of several
entries.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">The last type <B>cursor</B> realises a
sliding cursor, permitting to enter a numeric variable. Compared with
other entries, it has 3 additional field : number of decimal points,
starting value, end value.</P>
<P>The special entries <B>separator</B> and <B>noreturn</B> are meant
for formatting the Dialogbox. <B>separator</B> draw a thin horizontal

<P><BR><FONT FACE="Courier">FORMBOX</FONT> is the static version of
<FONT FACE="Courier">DIALOGBOX</FONT>. It builds a form that will
remain after the completion of the command (as <FONT FACE="Courier">BUTTONBOX</FONT>
does) and will survive as long as the user does not explicitly closes
it. <FONT FACE="Courier">FORMBOX</FONT> need an additional field (the
callback) which describes the <I>Gifa</I> command to be executed when
the user clicks on the <FONT FACE="Courier">Ok</FONT> or <FONT FACE="Courier">Apply</FONT>
buttons. Another difference is that <FONT FACE="Courier">FORMBOX</FONT>
can accept an additional field type : <B>action</B> which takes its
following argument as a <I>Gifa</I> command, and binds it to a new
button.</P>
<P>Apart from this, the definition of <FONT FACE="Courier">FORMBOX</FONT>
is strictly equivalent to that of <FONT FACE="Courier">DIALOGBOX</FONT>.
If not global, a variable associated to a field in a <FONT FACE="Courier">FORMBOX</FONT>
is local to the <FONT FACE="Courier">FORMBOX</FONT>, and cannot be
accessed in any other macros but the in callback line.</P>
