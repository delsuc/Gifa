<H1>INTRODUCTION</H1>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">One of the strength of the <I>Gifa</I>
program is its macro language. Many features of the standard program
are actually developed as macros. For the lay user, this insures that
the program will react exactly the same on all the computer platforms
for which <I>Gifa</I> is designed; and warrants a fast development of
high level features. 
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">For advanced users, the benefit is much
larger of course, as you can adapt the distributed macros to more
finely fit your needs, or you can write your own macros to realises
specific features.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">The macro language is rich enough to
permit to create easily sophisticate mathematical processing or high
level control structures with a full graphical user interface.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">The purpose of this chapter is to help
you in writing such macros.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Macros are simply files that contains
commands as they could have been typed at the <I>Gifa</I> prompt. Any
command that can be used in-line can be used in a macro, and nearly
every command and syntax that is used in a macro can be used in-line.
Of course there is more than that, you can define variables, use
control structures, access contexts, use functions, build graphic
interfaces, macros can be called from within macros. 
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Most of this manual describes feature
which are not specific to macro programming, but rather are generic
to the program. They have been put here because they are mostly
relevant to macro programming.</P>
