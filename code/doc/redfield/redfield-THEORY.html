<h2>
<A NAME="Heading3">The multi-exponential expression of the NOE intensities</A></h2>

<p><br>
	One can express the nOe intensities obtained from a NOESY experiment, as a
series of symmetric matrices <sub>
<IMG SRC="redfield01.gif"></sub>,
where <sub>
<IMG SRC="redfield02.gif"></sub>
holds the intensity of the cross peak between atoms i and j, for a NOESY mixing
time of <sub>
<IMG SRC="redfield03.gif"></sub>.
The relaxation parameters for each pair of spins can be presented as the
relaxation matrix <sub>
<IMG SRC="redfield04.gif"></sub>.
<sub>
<IMG SRC="redfield05.gif"></sub>is
bound to the nOe intensity matrix <sub>
<IMG SRC="redfield06.gif"></sub>
by the relation :<br>
	<sub>
<IMG SRC="redfield07.gif"></sub>
					(1)<br>
where I<sub>o</sub> is a diagonal matrix with elements equal to the equilibrium
magnetizations of each respective spin. <br>
	If the complete experimental determination of the <sub>
<IMG SRC="redfield08.gif"></sub>
matrix can be performed at a given <sub>
<IMG SRC="redfield09.gif"></sub>,
then the determination of <sub>
<IMG SRC="redfield10.gif"></sub>
is straightforward. However this is seldom the case, due to overlaps in the 2D
NOESY spectra.<br>
	The problem is then one of incompleteness of <sub>
<IMG SRC="redfield11.gif"></sub>
and several procedures have been proposed to interpret quantitative NOESY
information in terms of the  relaxation matrix <sub>
<IMG SRC="redfield12.gif"></sub>.
We will show here, that this incompleteness can be avoided if one takes a
different approach to the problem.<br>
	The relaxation matrix is symmetric, provided we use the construction proposed
by Olejniczak (Olejniczak, E. T. (1989) <i>J. Magn. Res.</i> <b>81</b>,
392-394). It can be diagonalized :<br>
	<sub>
<IMG SRC="redfield13.gif"></sub>
									(2)<br>
where <sub>
<IMG SRC="redfield14.gif"></sub>
is a diagonal matrix, and I is thus computed by :<br>
	<sub>
<IMG SRC="redfield15.gif"></sub>
								(3)<br>
From Eq. (2) we can rewrite each element of matrix <sub>
<IMG SRC="redfield16.gif"></sub>
in the following way :<br>
	<sub>
<IMG SRC="redfield17.gif"></sub>
									(4)<br>
so that each element of matrix I becomes :<br>
	<sub>
<IMG SRC="redfield18.gif"></sub>
							(5)<br>
where the <sub>
<IMG SRC="redfield19.gif"></sub>
is the (i,k) element of the matrix L, and <sub>
<IMG SRC="redfield20.gif"></sub>
is the <sub>
<IMG SRC="redfield21.gif"></sub>
element of the diagonal matrix <sub>
<IMG SRC="redfield22.gif"></sub>.
We can rewrite Eqs. (4) and (5) as follows :<br>
	<sub>
<IMG SRC="redfield23.gif"></sub>
							(6)<br>
and : 	<sub>
<IMG SRC="redfield24.gif"></sub>
								(7)<br>
where : 	 <sub>
<IMG SRC="redfield25.gif">
								(8)</sub><br>
	The form of Eq. (6) proves that NOESY build-up curves are sums of
exponentials. Eqs. (6) and (7) show that we can deduce the value of the
relaxation matrix elements from the analytical form of the build-up curve.<br>
	The process we propose for computing the relaxation matrix elements from the
NOESY experimental intensities is then, given an experimental nOe build-up
curve  <sub>
<IMG SRC="redfield26.gif"></sub>
measured between atoms i and j, to extract the parameters <sub>
<IMG SRC="redfield27.gif"></sub>
 and <sub>
<IMG SRC="redfield28.gif"></sub>
of the multi-exponential decay.<br>
	From the parameters <sub>
<IMG SRC="redfield29.gif"></sub>
and <sub>
<IMG SRC="redfield30.gif"></sub>
it is then easy to obtain the values of the relaxation parameter <sub>
<IMG SRC="redfield31.gif"></sub>.
Subsequently, it is possible to extract distance information, by assuming a
dynamic model for the molecule (for instance rigid spherical tumbling).<br>
	In Gifa, the LP-SVD method is used for multiexponential analysis of the
curves, because it permits the separation of the signal parameters from
additional parameters arising from the noise.</p>

<h2>
<A NAME="Heading4">Processing the complexe conjugate roots</A></h2>

<p><br>
	When the noise level is high, however, instability in the polynomial rooting
may generate complex roots outside the unit-circle. In this case, these roots
are found as complex conjugated doublets called "Froissard doublets". Such
doublets lead to very inaccurate reconstruction of the respective relaxation
matrix elements. To circumvent this problem, we propose the rotation of such
doublets around the median point, before the amplitude estimate, in order to
bring the roots back to the real axis.<br>
	A Froissard doublet is characterized by two related roots, located within the
unit-circle, with opposite frequencies, opposite imaginary phases and the same
amplitudes and damping factors:<br>
		<sub>
<IMG SRC="redfield32.gif"></sub>
	<sub>
<IMG SRC="redfield33.gif"></sub>
					(A1)<br>
time dependence generated by such a pattern is:<br>
	<sub>
<IMG SRC="redfield34.gif"></sub>
				(A2)<br>
				<sub>
<IMG SRC="redfield35.gif"></sub>
	if  <sub>
<IMG SRC="redfield36.gif"></sub>
<br>
the rotation leads to:<br>
	<sub>
<IMG SRC="redfield37.gif"></sub>
	<sub>
<IMG SRC="redfield38.gif"></sub>
						(A3)<br>
which gives:<br>
	<sub>
<IMG SRC="redfield39.gif"></sub>
					(A4)<br>
			<sub>
<IMG SRC="redfield40.gif"></sub>
	if  <sub>
<IMG SRC="redfield41.gif"></sub>
 and <sub>
<IMG SRC="redfield42.gif"></sub>
<br>
The developments of the two expressions are very similar and equivalent for
small values of bt. The operation permitting the replacement of Eq. (A2) by
(A4) is equivalent to pivoting the root doublet by <sub>
<IMG SRC="redfield43.gif"></sub>
about the center of the doublet, bringing the roots back onto the real axis.<br>
	This operation does not modify the first order of the build-up curve
reconstruction and can be safely used when the imaginary part of the complex
root is small compared to the real part. This condition can be translated into
geometric terms, by enforcing that the complex roots must lie within a cone of
angular extent <sub>
<IMG SRC="redfield44.gif"></sub>.<br>
	In some cases however, particularly when the signal to noise ratio is very
low, the LP-SVD analysis produces complex root doublets corresponding to higher
frequencies for which the equations A2) and (A4) are no longer equivalent. In
this case the fast frequencies detected in the signal are probably associated
to the noise. We thus chose to ignore the related roots altogether for the
amplitude reconstruction step. This decision was supported by the fact that the
corresponding amplitudes, when computed, often appear to be at least one order
of magnitude smaller than the other amplitudes.</p>

<h2>
<A NAME="Heading5">Checking the quality of the analysis</A></h2>

<p><br>
	From the multi-exponential analysis performed on the build-up curve as
described, the relaxation parameter <sub>
<IMG SRC="redfield45.gif"></sub>
is computed as shown in Eq. (7). It is obvious that the accuracy of the
determination of the relaxation parameter is critically related to the accuracy
of the multi-exponential analysis. In order to check the quality of this
analysis, for each build-up curve processed, an "R factor" can be
computed,.much in the way X-ray crystallographers do.<br>
		<sub>
<IMG SRC="redfield46.gif"></sub><sup>
	</sup>					(10)<br>
Here <sub>
<IMG SRC="redfield47.gif"></sub>
is the value of the calculated build-up curve reconstructed from the
multi-exponential parameters, and <sub>
<IMG SRC="redfield48.gif"></sub>
is the "experimental" data, for k running on the different values of <sub>
<IMG SRC="redfield49.gif"></sub>.
We found the R factor to be more discriminant when computed only for small
values of <sub>
<IMG SRC="redfield50.gif"></sub>.</p>

<h2>
<A NAME="Heading6">Calculating the distances from the relaxation rates</A></h2>

<p><br>
	From the rates, the distances can be calculated, by assuming a dynamic model
for the molecule. In Gifa, the rigid spherical tumbling model is available and
permits to calculate the distances from the relaxation rates, in the following
way. Having chosen a calibration rate <sub>
<IMG SRC="redfield51.gif"></sub>,
corresponding to the known distance d<sub>o</sub>, all other distances
d<sub>ij</sub> are obtained from the rates <sub>
<IMG SRC="redfield52.gif"></sub>
