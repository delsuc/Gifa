<p>	A set of command as been implemented into Gifa in order to permit the
processing as described above. The set-up is such that these commands should be
used in conjonction with the Lineara Prediction Module of Gifa. The processing
should thus be performed on a build-up curve, held into the regular 1D area of
Gifa. This build-up curve should be such as obtained with a set of NOESY
spectra, obtained for various value of the mixing time [tau]m, regularly
sampled from 0 to Tmax. It should be noted that the value for <sub>
<IMG SRC="redfield54.gif"></sub>
is assumed to be present. However it is rarely usefull to measure this value,
and it is preferable to insert a 0 value as the <sub>
<IMG SRC="redfield55.gif"></sub>
point of the build-up curve.</p>

<h2>
<A NAME="Heading8">The Different Commands</A></h2>

<p>
Build-up curve analysis thus starts as a regular 1D LP-SVD analysis. Commands
specific to the processing described above are the following :<br>
RELAXRATE	Permits to get the relaxation rate from the amplitude and the damping
factors, which are obtained by the multi-exponential analysis of the build-up
curve.<br>
METH p	Determine the hydrogen pair type. p is either 1, 2 or 3 for
hydrogen-hydrogen, hydrogen-methyl or methyl-methyl pairs.<br>
DIST	Performs the distance calculation from the relaxation rate,  using a
reference distance, and the type of hydrogen pair observed.<br>
CALIBDI dist_ref rate_ref	Permits to define a reference rate, which corresponds
to a  reference distance, a the motion model considered.<br>
RCRYST n	Performs the computation of a "crystallographic factor", between the
data obtained from the multi-exponential analysis and the initial data. This
factor is calculated from the first n curve points.<br>
SLOPE n	Performs a least-square fit on the n first curve points, to determine
his initial slope.<br>
RTPIV [alpha]	Performs the processing of the pairs of complexe conjugate roots,
which can be obtained when solving the PE polynomial. The roots found inside
the cone of extent [theta], are pivoted, those outside are removed: [alpha]=
cotan([theta]). Works only with forward roots.<br>
The following internal variables are available :<br>
	$RELAX  $RCRYST  $CALIBDI[]  $DIST</p>
