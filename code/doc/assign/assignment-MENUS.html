<p>	When entering the assignment mode, Gifa will set up an assignment
environment with the basic menus, the Peak menus and 4 additional menus that
give access to all the commands needed to performed spectral assignment. The
macro <tt>env_att.g</tt> actually sets-up every thing for assignment..</p>

<h2>
<A NAME="Heading8">Project menu</A></h2>

<p>This
menu permits to create or select a project, and more generally to realize all
the operations global to the project.</p>

<h3>
<A NAME="Heading9">Help (short)</A></h3>

<p>Produces
a short help of the assignement module as a 'recipe' to use it. The complete
assignment help contained in the HTML documentation can be called from this
short help.</p>

<h3>
<A NAME="Heading10">New Project</A></h3>

<p>To
create a new project. It will create a directory with all the empty data-bases.
You will be also prompted for the primary sequence of the studied protein. The
primary sequence can be given, either literally in 1 letter code, from a file
(1 or 3 letter code), or from a PDB file.</p>

<h3>
<A NAME="Heading11">Select Project</A></h3>

<p>Permit
to select any previously created project. Only one project can be used at a
time.<br>
When selecting a project, you have the choice, in the dialog box, to either
create a backup of the current state of the project (simply a tar file), to
recover from a previous backup (thus deleting the current state) or not to do
any action.<br>
After selection, the number of assigned systems is displayed on screen, then
the <b>multi zoom</b> tool and the <b>File Selector</b> tool are opened.</p>

<h3>
<A NAME="Heading12">Change param</A></h3>

<p>A
set of parameters is stored with the project, these parameters can be changed
from here.<br>
<IMG SRC="assignment01.GIF"><br>
You can define : <ul>
<li>	Peak alignment tolerance, used when searching for peaks alignment or
spin/peak alignment
<li>	Tolerance for finding peaks is the maximum distance allowed when searching
for a peak by coordinates.
<li>	Standard Display parameters, that will be set when entering the project :
<tt>SCALE</tt> (display height as defined with the zoom box) <tt>LOGA</tt>
(contour spacing) number of <tt>LEVEL</tt> and <tt>SIGN</tt> of display (1 :
only positive, -1 : only negative, 0 : both).
<li>	Integration box sizes define the size of the box, used either for display
and for integration.</ul></p>

<h3>
<A NAME="Heading13">Save data-bases</A></h3>

<p>The
assignment data-bases are permanently kept on file, however, in case of a
program crash, the last modifications may be lost. Clicking here secures the
very last entries.</p>

<h3>
<A NAME="Heading14">Make backup</A></h3>

<p>Copy
the current backup file backup.tar to backup.tar.old, and store the current dbm
files of the project in the archive file backup.tar, produced by the command tar.</p>

<h3>
<A NAME="Heading15">File Selector</A></h3>

<p>Start
the <tt>File Selector</tt> box:<br>
<IMG SRC="assignment02.GIF"><br>
All the spectra which are used in the project should be accessed from here. A
spectrum can be loaded in memory, in the same time the associated peak
data-base is loaded. A spectrum can also be only showed (see the 
<a TARGET="_top" href="../Scommands.html#SHOWC">SHOWC</a>
command in the documentation), displaying it on screen, but not loading it in
memory, in which case the intensity ratio cursor permits to adapt the intensity
display to the current scale.<br>
When loading a file in-memory, the related peak data-base is opened, and the
peak data base of the previously displayed spectrum is closed. if the file
loaded in-memory has no associated peak data base, a new one is created.<br>
Note that you can also use the 
<a TARGET="_top" href="../Scommands.html#super2d">super2d</a>
tool (in the display menu) to display several spectra superimposed, by default,
in super2d, you will be prompt for using the last dataset used with the
<tt>Showc</tt> button.</p>

<h3>
<A NAME="Heading16">Add spectra</A></h3>

<p>From
here, you can add a spectrum to the list of the currently used spectra.
"Adding" a spectrum consists in either copying or linking it into the dedicated
directory(see above, <b>File set-up</b>). Linking sets a UNIX <i>soft-link
</i>which stores the address of the file only, thus permitting an important
gain in disk space.</p>

<h3>
<A NAME="Heading17">Add PDB file</A></h3>

<p>Permit
to add a PDB file to the list of the currently used PDB files, in a way
analogous to the way used for spectra (see the previous command 'Add spectra').
This PDB file list is used in the 'Find distance' command (see the
<i>utilities</i> menu below).</p>

<h3>
<A NAME="Heading18">Stat on Primary seq</A></h3>

<p>Produce
statistics on the amino acids contained in the primary sequence.</p>

<h3>
<A NAME="Heading19">Copy pk to peak db</A></h3>

<p>This
one permits to copy the content of the peak table (obtained with the Peak
picking tool) to the peak data-base. Peak will be there but without assignment
of course. This permits to load a first set of peaks, for instance the finger
print region, from which the assignment work can proceed.<br>
	This command can be issued several time and at any moment during the
assignment work, thus adding peaks into the assignment data-base.</p>

<h3>
<A NAME="Heading20">Rem unassigned peaks</A></h3>

<p>Remove
the unassigned peaks from the peak data-base. The unassigned peaks are those
for which no spin has been assigned in F1 or F2.</p>

<h3>
<A NAME="Heading21">Copy the db from another data-set</A></h3>

<p>Copy
the peak data-base of a data-set of the spectra list to the peak data-base of
another data-set of the list. The command asks for the permission to erase an
already existing data-base.</p>

<h3>
<A NAME="Heading22">Merge the peak table into the db</A></h3>

<p>Merge
the peak table with the peak database of the assignment projet. <br>
For each peak of the peak table,  the command looks at the closest element of
the database within the click tolerance and change the spectral coordinates and
intensity of this element to the peak coordinates and intensity. The assignment
information of the dbm element is unchanged. If no database element in found
within the peak tolerance, the peak is added to the data-base as an unassigned
element.</p>

<h3>
<A NAME="Heading23">Import db from BMRB file</A></h3>

<p>This
tool can be used when starting an assignment project for a protein for which an
assignment information is already available. The information can be either
available in BioMagResBank data format (see<A HREF="http://www.bmrb.wisc.edu/" TARGET="_top">http://www.bmrb.wisc.edu/</A>
 ) or in plain ascii format (see next menu entry)<br>
<IMG SRC="assignment03.GIF"><br>
From there, you can specify the BMRB file name, the action to be taken (add to
the current db or start a new one), which spins should be considered : all,
<sup>1</sup>H and <sup>15</sup>N or only <sup>1</sup>H; and finally, if a check
on spin validity (checking if the spin name agrees with the names defined in
the topology file) should be performed.<br>
From the file, only the spins and the spin systems will be defined. The peak db
will not be filled but will had to be filled independently (see below).</p>

<h3>
<A NAME="Heading24">Import db from ascii file</A></h3>

<p>Same
as above, but in free ascii format. So far, only 2 file formats are handled,
both are one line per spin system, with the following formats :<br>
format 1 :</p>

<pre>
primary_number res_name 15N_chem_shift Ha_chem_shift Hb_chem_shift, etc...
</pre>
<p>format
2 :</p>

<pre>
res_name primary_number 15N_chem_shift Ha_chem_shift Hb_chem_shift, etc...
</pre>
<p>where
etc.. represent the list of chemical shift given along the residue side
chain.<br>
You can adapt this macro to fit your specific needs by modifying the
<tt>ascii2spin</tt> macro</p>

<h3>
<A NAME="Heading25">Create peak db from current spin system definitions</A></h3>

<p>This
command takes the current spin-system and spin definitions, and create
assignment peaks for each possible peaks for the current experiement.</p>

<h3>
<A NAME="Heading26">... Integration module</A></h3>

<p>This
command will add the Integration menu which permits to quantify precisely one,
or a set of experiments. Useful for quantifying a NOESY experiement, building
build-up curve, and generating the constraints file for structure generation.</p>

<h3>
<A NAME="Heading27">... Relaxation module</A></h3>

<p>This
command will add the Dynamic menu which permits to handle set of 2D experiment
for relaxation measurements. Useful to realize the integration of a set of
T<sub>1</sub> or T<sub>2</sub> heteronuclear or homonuclear experiments, and
then to extract the relaxation parameters, with precise error estimate. Support
for measuring heteronuclear J coupling is also available.</p>

<h3>
<A NAME="Heading28">Quit Assignment</A></h3>

<p>Use
this entry if you want to quit the assignment module and restore a normal set-up</p>

<h2>
<A NAME="Heading29">data-bases menu</A></h2>

<p>This
menu permits to graphically display and to modify the assignment data-bases
(peak, spin or spin system data-bases)..</p>

<h3>
<A NAME="Heading30">Show database</A></h3>

<p>This
command displays on the current spectral zoom all the peaks in the current peak
data base.<br>
<IMG SRC="assignment04.GIF"><br>
in this exemple red sqaures are intra-residue peaks and yellow peaks are
inter-residue peaks. Unassigned peaks are displayed as crosses.</p>

<h3>
<A NAME="Heading31">Show all peaks</A></h3>

<p>Is
equivalent to the previous command except that only the square will be drawn,
thus making a display easier to read in the case of dense spectra. No color
coding will be used either.</p>

<h3>
<A NAME="Heading32">Show unassigned peaks</A></h3>

<p>This
command displays on the current spectral zoom all the unassigned peaks in the
current peak database. The unassigned peaks are those for which the F1 or F2
spin has not been assigned.</p>

<h3>
<A NAME="Heading33">Show selected peaks</A></h3>

<p>This
command displays on the current spectral zoom all the peaks verifying different
criteria given by the user. Peaks can be displayed depending on the value of
the peak note, the spins notes, the residue numbers or types, the spin types
and the peak intensity (maximum value or threshold). The criteria for peak and
spin notes and spin types are tested as substrings of the peak.corresponding
parameters.<br>
The criteria can be applied according to a logical parameter: 'and' means that
all the given criteria must be verified to display the peak, 'or' means that
one verified criterion is sufficient to display the peak.<br>
<IMG SRC="assignment05.GIF"><br>
In the exemple above, only peaks were the H<sub>
<IMG SRC="assignment06.GIF"></sub>
of a Leucine is involved will be displayed</p>

<h3>
<A NAME="Heading34">Find a peak</A></h3>

<p>After
selecting this command, the program will wait until you click on a peak on the
spectrum, and will high-light the selected peak as well as print its id in the
terminal screen.</p>

<h3>
<A NAME="Heading35">Edit a peak</A></h3>

<p>As
the previous command, but an edition box for the selected peak will show up.
You directly see the content of the assignment data-base, and can actually
modify it. If the peak is already assigned, you will be able to see/edit the
corresponding spins.<br>
<IMG SRC="assignment07.GIF"><br>
You can also center the zoom window on that peak, move the peak (click on the
new peak location), and align the associated spins to that peak (remember that
chemical shifts are handled independantly in the peak db and in the peak db).</p>

<h3>
<A NAME="Heading36">Create new peak</A></h3>

<p>This
command wait until you click on the spectral window, and creates a new entry in
the peak data-base. If a peak already exists within the distance tolerance for
the mouse clicking, the program asks to user a confirmation for creating the
peak. The new peak is then edited.</p>

<h3>
<A NAME="Heading37">Find a spin</A></h3>

<p>After
selecting this command, the program will wait until you click on the spectrum,
and will propose spins close to the click points, indicated along which axis
(F1/F2) they are found.</p>

<h3>
<A NAME="Heading38">Edit a spin</A></h3>

<p>As
the previous command, but an edition box for the selected spin will show up.
You directly see the content of the assignment data-base, and can actually
modify it. Related peaks and spin system can also be edited.<br>
<IMG SRC="assignment08.GIF"><br>
As for peak, you can move or remove the spin, you can also align all the peak
in the db to the current chemical shift of this spin.</p>

<h3>
<A NAME="Heading39">Create new spin</A></h3>

<p>After
selecting this command, the program will ask you along which axis (F1/F2) you
want to create a new spin. Then, it will wait until you click on the spectral
window, and creates a new entry in the spin data-base. The new spin is then
edited.</p>

<h3>
<A NAME="Heading40">List all spins</A></h3>

<p>This
command produces a clickable list of all the spins in the data-base.<br>
<IMG SRC="assignment09.GIF"><br>
from there, you can either show or edit each currently defined spins.</p>

<h3>
<A NAME="Heading41">Find a syst</A></h3>

<p>After
selecting this command, the program will wait until you click on a peak on the
spectrum, and will high-light the related spin-system, if it exists.</p>

<h3>
<A NAME="Heading42">Edit a syst</A></h3>

<p>As
the previous command, but an edition box for the selected spin system will show
up. You directly see the content of the assignment data-base, and can actually
modify it. Related peaks and spins can also be edited.<br>
 
<IMG SRC="assignment10.GIF"><br>
	When the spin system type has been defined by the user, the list of possible
spin names is restricted to the list defined in the topology data-base. The
<tt>Create Peaks</tt> button, will create peaks at all the peaks in the peak db
that could exist at the spin crossing.<br>
The <tt>Show</tt> button will graphically display the spin-system :<br>
<IMG SRC="assignment11.GIF"><br>
The button <tt>refresh</tt> close the opened system formbox, and open a new one
containing the last modifications.<br>
The <tt>RESCUE</tt> button will trigger the Rescue computation, which uses a
neural network technology for searching assignment possibilities from the set
of defined chemical shift. See<A HREF="http://www.infobiosud.univ-montp1.fr/SERVEUR/RESCUE/rescue.html" TARGET="_top">http://www.infobiosud.univ-montp1.fr/SERVEUR/RESCUE/rescue.html</A>
 for details. The result in the present case would be:</p>

<IMG SRC="assignment14.GIF"></p>

<h3>
<A NAME="Heading47">Show Primary Seq</A></h3>

<p>This
command builds a form box, with one line per residue in the primary sequence of
the molecule under study. Each assigned residue is associated to a button
showing the corresponding spin-system on screen, and to another button allowing
to edit it.</p>

<h2>
<A NAME="Heading48">graph tools menu</A></h2>

<p>This
menu contains all the basic graphics tool which are used to detect peak
alignment and build new spin systems. </p>

<h3>
<A NAME="Heading49">Choose base color</A></h3>

<p>Most
display command use a contrasting color (see 
<a TARGET="_top" href="../Scommands.html#SCOLOR">SCOLOR</a>
in documentation). This utility permit to define which color will be used.</p>

<h3>
<A NAME="Heading50">Point</A></h3>

<p>This
is equivalent to the standard 
<a TARGET="_top" href="../Pcommands.html#point">point</a>
macro : you can click on the current spectrum, and the coordinates of the
clicked point are printed, and a cross is drawn at the click point location.
You exit the point command by clicking on the third button of the mouse.</p>

<h3>
<A NAME="Heading51">Marker</A></h3>

<p>This
is the main tool for detecting peak alignment and for building the build list.
When activating the command, you are prompted to click on each spectral
location that you want to put in the marker. When finished, click on the third
button of the mouse. A box is then created, which will remain on screen as long
as you do not close it purposely.<br>
<IMG SRC="assignment15.GIF"><br>
From the marker box you can choose to redraw all the horizontal and vertical
lines connecting the selected points.  You can choose to have
diagonal-symmetric locations considered or not, and choose the color. You can
extend the current marker, clicking on new locations on the spectrum, this will
create a new marker containing the new locations as well as the previous ones.
You can show all the peaks in the data-base lying at the intersection of an
horizontal and vertical lines, as well as create missing peaks. Finally, you
can add all the peaks detected at the intersections to the build list.</p>

<h3>

<h3>
<A NAME="Heading55">Add peak to list</A></h3>

<p>Permits
to add a peak to the build-list.</p>

<h3>
<A NAME="Heading56">Promote to spin syst</A></h3>

<p>This
is the command that will use the actual build list, and create a new
spin-system. First, alignment are detected within the peaks in the build list,
and spins are detected for each spectral coordinates. If needed, new spins are
created. Then a new spin system is created.<br>
Finally, the tool permitting to edit the spin-system is opened from which you
can modify the spin-system parameters and edit each individual spins.</p>

<h2>
<A NAME="Heading57">utilities menu</A></h2>

<p>This
menu contains various utility commands, which allow to chck the integrity of
the current assignment state, its consistency with structural information
obtained from a PDB file. These conmands also permit to output assignment
information. </p>

<h3>
<A NAME="Heading58">Check data bases</A></h3>

<p>Checks
all current assignment data-bases for integrity. Because of a bug in the
foreach code, this command may have to be applied more than once in case of
wrong entries. In particular, this command checks the consistency between  the
chemical shifts of the spins assigned to a peak and the chemical shifts of this
peak. It also checks for internal coherence.</p>

<h3>
<A NAME="Heading59">Check topology of spin systs</A></h3>

<p>Check
that all spins of each spin system are defined in the current topology
database. The topology data base file is located in the
/usr/local/gifa/macro/att directory. For each spin system type, it contains the
allowed list of spin names, including the individual hydrogen names and generic
names for superposed geminal hydrogens. This file can be modified by the user
to fit other topologies (see macro programming).</p>

<h3>
<A NAME="Heading60">Low-level editor</A></h3>

<p>Creates
a formbox which permits direct editing to each spin, syst and peak, according
to their index in the data-base.</p>

<h3>
<A NAME="Heading61">Find distances</A></h3>

<p>This
command permits to click on the spectrum, and high-light the closest peak in
the database. Then, it creates a dialog box to look for the distances between
hydrogens involved in the selected correlation. The PDB files you can scan are
given by the PDB file list.<br>
You can select atoms by their exact names or by a substring of their names (as
an example, looking for the 'HB' substring will permit to find all the
hydrogens HB1, HB2, HB3,...). If you want to search among all the residues or
all the atoms, put the sign '.' into the corresponding field of the dialog
box.<br>
This command is based on a perl script calcdst.pl located in
/usr/local/gifa/com/att directory.</p>

<h3>
<A NAME="Heading62">Peak Listing</A></h3>

<p>Lists
all the peak database entries to a file. Here is un example of listing file:</p>

<h3>
<A NAME="Heading66">Plot database</A></h3>

<p>Plots
on file the labels of the elements of peak current database, which are located
in the current zoom window.</p>

<h3>
<A NAME="Heading67">Plot one lable</A></h3>

<p>Plots
on file only one peak label, usefull for annotating only a few peaks on the plot.</p>

<h3>
<A NAME="Heading68">Recalibrate current Experiment</A></h3>

<p>This
command permits to recalibrate a given experiment (change the definition of the
0 ppm point) while maintaining the position of the peaks. Indeed, peaks are
handled in ppm, so recalibrating the experiemnt without taking care of the
peaks would end-up with peaks db entries not located anymore on the
corresponding spectral location.</p>

<h3>
<A NAME="Heading69">Build strip plot from 3D HSQC</A></h3>

<p>This
command permits to build a composite 2D strip-plot file from a 3D HSQC
experiment, much in the way the related command in the 3D module would do.
However here, the strip plot is build from the current assignment databse as
would be defined for a 2D HSQC. Strips will then be ordered  in the pseudo F2
axis in primary sequence order.<br>
Plots on file only one peak label, usefull for annotating only a few peaks on
the plot.
