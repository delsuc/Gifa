MACRO PROGRAMMING</H1>
<p>The complete assignment module is written in nothing but macros. So you
could have written it yourself ! At least you can modify it to fit your needs.
Here is some help to do so.<br>
All the macros are in <i>/usr/local/gifa/macro/att </i>, this address is added
to the <tt>GifaPath</tt> when entering the module. Static information (list of
possible atom names, residue names, etc...) are defined in the
<i>basic_db.g</i> and <i>build_static_db.g</i> macros. You can very simply
adapt this one for some new residues. Some static information is stored in dbm
data-bases: the "topology" data-base stores the structures of the different
residues defined and the names of valid spins. The data-base 3let_1let and
1let_3let stores lookup tables permitting to convert rapidly 1 lettre residue
names (C Y K..) to 3 letters names (Cys Typ Lys...). These 3 dat-bases are also
stored in /usr/local/gifa/macro/att and can be recreated with the
build_static_db.g macro. This can be done if you want to add new types of
residues, it may also be needed in the case of a new installation of Gifa,
since the dbm format is not fully binary compatible among all UNIX platforms
(be carefull, you, Limux users). <br>
The static data-bases are opened when entering the assignment module. Other
data-bases are associated to the project associative arrays <tt>att[]
spin[]</tt> and <tt>sys[]</tt> for the peak data-base, the spin data-base, and
the spin-system data-base respectively. Entries are thus of the kind :
<tt>$att[$peak_id]</tt> for instance. The different pieces of information are
stored as blank separated fields in the variable. Coding is the following :</p>

<pre>
	$att[#att] = f1 f2 amp #spin1 #spin2 type note
	$spin[#spin] = delta  name #sys note
	$sys[#sys] = index type list_of_spin note
</pre>
<p>where<br>
<tt>#att, #spin #sys</tt> are used here to note the indexes.<br>
<tt>f1</tt> and <tt>f2</tt> are coordinates in ppm;<br>
<tt>amp</tt> is the peak amplitude in arbitrary unit;<br>
<tt>type</tt> codes for the kind of experiment;<br>
<tt>delta</tt> is chemical shift in ppm;<br>
<tt>index</tt> is the number in the primary sequence<br>
<tt>type</tt> is the name of the residue<br>
<tt>note</tt> is a free field, that you can use for whatever function.<br>
Each dbm associative array <tt>att[] spin[]</tt> and <tt>sys[]</tt> contain the
special entry LARGEST, which contains the index of the LARGEST id (<tt>#att,
#spin, or #sys</tt>) yet assigned. So, when creating a new entry (spin in the
example), you are supposed to do something like :</p>

<pre>
	set new_id = ($spin["LARGEST"] + 1)
	set $spin[$new_id ] = "New entry ..."
	set $spin["LARGEST"] = $new_id		; updated only if no error occured
</pre>
<p><br>
When programming some function that scan the whole data-base, you will probably
end-up writing something like :</p>

<pre>
foreach i in att           	; let's scan all the peak as an example
	if ($i s! "LARGEST") then         ; don't forget this one !
		set peak = $att[$i]	              ; this is the complete entry
     ; then parse the entry, this is one way :
		set f1 = (head($peak))	set peak = (tail($peak))
		set f2 = (head($peak))	set peak = (tail($peak))
		set amp = (head($peak))	set peak = (tail($peak))
                                                ; etc...
	endif
endfor
</pre>
<p>When
loaded, the calibration distances defined by the command <b>Choose the
calibration intensities</b>, are stored in an associative array called
calib_dst[]. <br>
If you manage to make something useful, you can transmit it to me so that I
will make it available to other users.
