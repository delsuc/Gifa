<h2>
<A NAME="Heading90">Dynamic menu</A></h2>

<p>
This menu is optionnal, it can be added from the process menu. It contains a
set of tools aimed toward the integration and the processing of a set of 2D
containing a relaxation experiment. For instance as would be obtained from a
heteronuclear relaxation experiment. It assumes that all the experiment are
located is spectra of the current projet, and that one of these experiment has
a completely assigned peak db. All commands should be applied from this
assigned experiment, as the assignement db will be used.<br>
	Some commands (one peak processing; integration) work from the current
experiemnt while others (processing (fitting); Monte-Carlo analysis) do their
processing from file.<br>
All relative files are stored in the "processing" directory.<br>
	The tools used here are all defined in the
<tt>/usr/local/gifa/macro/att/dyna</tt> directory. There are all written in
macro, and rely on the FITGENE command for the relaxation parameter estimation.</p>

<h3>
<A NAME="Heading91">Data-set list</A></h3>

<p>This
command permits to define the name of the list which should contain all the
entries that will be used for integration and fitting, along with value of the
time parameter which was varied. This file should reside in the "processing"
directory of the current assignment project.<br>
Here an example of such a file :</p>

<pre>
; list of T1 experiments
0.018 01_T1 01_T1_bis 01_T1_tris
0.054 02_T1
0.102 03_T1
0.150 04_T1 04_T1_bis 04_T1_tris
0.210 05_T1
0.258 06_T1
0.306 07_T1
0.402 08_T1
0.498 09_T1
0.606 10_T1
0.810 11_T1
1.002 12_T1
1.506 13_T1
2.010 14_T1
2.502 15_T1
3.006 16_T1
</pre>
<p>You
can see that : comments are permitted. Each contain first the value of the
parameter, and the name of the experiemnt, as it appears in the spectra
directory. It is possible to have several experiment for the same delay, in
which case the variation of the intensity of a given peak over the different
experiments, corresponding to the same parameter, will be used for experimental
noise estimate.</p>

<h3>
<A NAME="Heading92">Integ/process one peak</A></h3>

<p><IMG SRC="assignment16.GIF"><br>
This box permits to realize the complete processing : integration and parameter
estimate for a given peak in the assignment database. You will have to
determine the following parameters :<ul>
<li>	the data-set list (as defined above)
<li>	the kind of error evaluation, which can be either Baseline (the baseline
noise, estimated on an empty spectral region for each dataset) or Multiexp
(estimated from the standard deviation of peaks for the experiemnt which have
been realized sevral time for the same time parameter)
<li>	The integration method, which is either MaxinBox (the maximum value in the
integration box) of Sumrec (the sum of the point in the integration box). The
integration box is defined with the parameter command in the project menu.
<li>	The data type, which determine the equation which will be fitted
:</ul><tt>R1</tt> is for T<sub>1</sub> relaxation data, fitted in
sec<sup>-1</sup>, equation which is fitted is<br>
<center> <sub>
<IMG SRC="assignment17.GIF"></sub><br>
where <sub>
<IMG SRC="assignment18.GIF"></sub>
is the time parameter defined in the dataset list</center><ul>
<li><tt></tt><sub></sub>R2 is for T2 relaxation data, fitted in sec-1, equation
which is fitted is</ul><center>
<IMG SRC="assignment19.GIF"></center><ul>
<li><tt></tt><tt></tt><tt></tt>NOE is for NOE measurement. In this case, there
is no time parameter defined in the dataset list, but the free parameter is
replaced by the two keywords : with and without which define respectiveley the
experiment performed with saturation and without saturation.
<li><tt></tt><tt></tt>T1 and T2 are equivalent to R1 and R2 but the following
equations are fitted :</ul><center><sub>
<IMG SRC="assignment20.GIF"></sub></center><ul>
<li>J corresponds to the following equation :</ul><center><sub>
<IMG SRC="assignment21.GIF"></sub><br>
which is found in J measurement experiment.</center><ul>
<li><tt></tt><tt></tt><tt></tt>These equations are defined in the proc1pk.g
macro which can be adapted to fit your needs. If you want to use all the tools
with the newly defined equation, you will have to adapt also the procMC.g
procalllst.g quant1pk.g showfit1pk.g and writproc.g macros as well.</ul>The
processing will compute error bars for the fitted parameters, which are
determined from the covariance matrix and the size of the intensity error as
found from the noise evaluation.<br>
Note that certain parameter combinations may not be meanningfull. For instance,
choosing Sumrec integration technique along with the Baseline error estimate
will lead to wrong error estimate.</p>

<h3>
<A NAME="Heading93">Show last processing</A></h3>

<p>This
command simply shows graphically the result of the last fit in the 1D window
:</p>

<pre>
FITGENE Final Chi2 :  14.391778
R2 1.63892 +/- .5887275E-01 I0 333448.6 +/- 4905.25
</pre>
<p><IMG SRC="assignment22.GIF"></p>

<h3>
<A NAME="Heading94">Integrate in zoom region</A></h3>

<p>This
command performs the first integration step when a complete set of peaks is
processed. Start in a zoom window, all assigned peaks within this window will
be processed. See <tt>Integ/process one peak</tt> for details on parameter
set-. The processing will create a integration file, called as the dataset list
file, with <tt>_integ</tt> concatenated at the end. Thus <tt>R1list</tt>
becomes <tt>R1lst_integ</tt>. This file is located in the processing directory.</p>

<h3>
<A NAME="Heading95">Process from file</A></h3>

<p>This
command will take the result of the previous integration command, and will
realize a fit for all the peak found in this file. See <tt>Integ/process one
peak</tt> for details on parameter set-up. The processing will create a result
file, called as the dataset list file, with <tt>_proc</tt> concatenated at the
end. Thus <tt>R1list</tt> becomes <tt>R1lst_proc. </tt>This file is located in
the processing directory.</p>

<h3>
<A NAME="Heading96">Do Monte-Carlo from file</A></h3>

<p>This
command takes the result found in the integration file and realize a
Monte-Carlo (MC) error estimate on the dataset.<br>
<IMG SRC="assignment23.GIF"><br>
	Along with classic parameter you will have to determine the number of MC
iterations and the MC method. The MC method can be either 'synthetic' or data.
synthetic corresponds to the classical MC run where a first fit is realized on
the experimental dataset, then a synthetic dataset is rebuilt from the fitted
parameter, and a larg number of simulated experiment, correspomding to
synthetic dataset added with noise will be fitted. The statistic on the
parameters (mean and standard deviation) are them used as a precise estimate of
the precision of the fit. The data method corresponds to a case where the
actual experimental dataset are perturbed with additive noise. Results of the
MC run will create a result file, called as the dataset list file, with
<tt>_MC</tt> concatenated at the end. Thus <tt>R1list</tt> becomes
<tt>R1lst_MC. </tt>This file is located in the processing directory.<br>
	For MC run you have the option of creating a complete detailed file (called
_stat) which permit to verify the chi2 statistic.<br>
	As MC runs tend to be very long in the present implementation, you have the
possibility of creating a standalone batch file which can then be started in
batch.
