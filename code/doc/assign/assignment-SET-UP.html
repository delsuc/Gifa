<h2>
<A NAME="Heading2">Presentation</A></h2>

<p>
This module implements a set of very simple assignment tools, which may however
proof to be useful. It is almost completely written in the Gifa macro language
(the command find_dist is based on a Perl script), and as such can be fully
adapted to your needs. Right now, it is principally aimed toward protein and
peptide assignment. Extending it to oligonucleotides and sugars is probably a
simple matter of extending the basic residues data-bases. However, I have no
idea whether it can be used to help in the assignment process of other kind of
organic molecules or not.<br>
	You will not find here any fancy tools nor automatic assignment, the only help
provided here consists in a set of tools permitting to visualise several
spectra at the same time, to add notes to peaks, to draw lines to help for
visual align search, and to store the information in several data-bases, one
for assigned peaks, one for spins and one for spin systems (consisting simply
in a set of spins). For the moment, this module works only for 2D data-sets and
has little support for heteronuclear 3D.<br>
	However, due to the Gifa versability (calling UNIX from Gifa, creating/reading
files, etc..) it is quite easy to adapt this canvas to your proper need, for
instance calling from within this set-up your favorite automatic assignment
tools.</p>

<h2>
<A NAME="Heading3">File set-up</A></h2>

<p>
A complete assignment is kept in a special directory, called a project. The
project, which may reside anywhere on the disk, holds several files and
directories used for storing informations, it may also contain any file that
the user may wish to keep.<br>
	In the project directory, you will find typically two files : The file
<i>parameters </i>is a macro which is executed when selecting the project. It
contains all the definitions and some basic environment variables. The file
<i>zoom_window </i>contains the zoom window coordinates for the 'multi-zoom'
tool (see the 
<a TARGET="_top" href="../Zcommands.html#ZOOM">ZOOM</a>
command in the documentation).<br>
	Five obliged directories reside also in the project.<br>
	The <i>db </i>directory holds the data-bases in dbm format as described below,
the primary sequence is also found in this directory in a file called
<i>primary</i>. The format is as follows : one residue per line, coded in
one-letter code.<br>
	The <i>spectra </i> and <i>PDB</i> directories hold respectively all the
spectra and PDB files associated with the project. Typically, for space
optimisation, links to actual experiment files will be stored here rather than
the complete file.<br>
	The <i>processing </i> and <i>constraint</i> directories hold respectively
the intensity curves and the constraint files generated by the
<i>Integration</i> and <i>Dynamic</i> menu (see below).</p>

<h2>
<A NAME="Heading4">Assignment Information Structure</A></h2>

<p>Assignment
information is stored as sets of peaks, spins and spin systems, with the
following structure :<ul>
<li>	each experiment is associated to a peak data base.
<li>	each peak in a given experiment can be assigned to 2 spins (one for each
spectral dimension). Along with the spin indexes, the coordinates of the peak
are stored, as well as its amplitude.
<li>	each spin is characterized by a chemical shift, a name and is associated
to a spin system (if assigned)
<li>	each spin system has an index in the primary sequence (when assigned), and
a set of spins.
<li>	for peak and spin entries a free field is also available for user notes
(not for spin systems).
<li>	all yet unknown piece of information can be set as unknown ("unk"), except
chemical shifts.
<li>	The peak, spin and spin system information is stored in three independent
dbm data bases.</ul></p>

<h2>
<A NAME="Heading5">data-bases</A></h2>

<p>
Except for the primary structure file presented above, there are 3 kind of
data-base files in the <i>db </i>directory, there are all in dbm format and
each of them is thus composed of two files <i>*.pag </i>and <i>*.dir </i>which
should not be modified directly. The dbm format is a generic UNIX format for
flat data bases. For instance, these files can very easily be accessed with the
<i>perl</i> language. Nevertheless, the dbm format is not fully compatible
among all UNIX platforms, and you should be carefull with that (specially Linux
users).<br>
	The <i>name_of_experiment.pag </i>and <i>name_of_experiment.dir </i>files hold
the peak data base for a given experiment. An entry in the peak data-base
stores all the pertinent information for a given peak. Peak entries can be
created by copying them from the peak-picker, or during the assignment process.
With a peak entry is stored two pointers to the spin databases, pointing to the
parent spins of this peak.<br>
<i>	Spin.pag </i>and <i>Spin.dir </i>is the spin base, a spin is stored as a
chemical shift, a name, and the spin-system to which it belongs.<br>
	Finally <i>Spin_sys.pag </i>and <i>Spin_sys.dir </i>is the spin-system base,
for each entry, the spin-system type, the index in the primary sequence, as
well as the list of the spins is stored.<br>
	In all the data-bases, entries are referred to by a numerical id that ranges
from 1 to the highest value. The value of the highest id used is stored in a
special entry indexed as "LARGEST". However, due to the very nature of the dbm
format used for the file, (and of the associative arrays used internally in
Gifa) there is no need for the id to be contiguous. So, if an entry is deleted,
the numbering of the other entries is unaffected.</p>

<h2>
<A NAME="Heading6">build list</A></h2>

<p>
The <b>build list</b> is the main tool for progressing in the assignment work.
The idea is to make a list of all the peaks within a spin-system (in the TOCSY
sense). Once this list is complete, it is possible to <i>promote</i> the list
to a new spin-system which is then entered in the data-base.<br>
	The build list is managed with a set of tools found in the <cite>graph
tool</cite> menu. The marker tool permits to detected peak alignments, and to
create a spin for each alignment. The list can be listed or displayed directly
on screen. And of course, the list can be promoted to a spin-system.
