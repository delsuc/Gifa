<A NAME="Heading98">assignment </A></h2>

<p>With
this set-up, a typical assignment work on a small protein, done in the
<i>W&uuml;thrich</i> way, consists in:<ol>
<li>	get a set of <i>nice </i>processed homonuclear<i> </i>2D experiments
somewhere on the computer system.
<li>	create a new project, enter the primary sequence, and link all your nice
<i>2D </i>into the <i>spectra </i>directory; then read-in the TOCSY.
<li>	peak-pick the TOCSY spectrum, at least on the finger print region and copy
it over into the assignment data-base, eventually redo so for the NH-side chain
regions.
<li>	use the <b>marker </b>tool to note peak alignments, eventually confirm by
"showing" also the NOESY, or a TOCSY from other experimental conditions.
<li>	once a spin system is found, and noted with one or several markers,
eventually create the corresponding additional peaks with marker tool, create
spins, and put them in the special "build-list";
<li>	<b>promote</b> the spin-list to a spin-system
<li>	go back to 4) as long as there are spin-systems to assign.
<li>	load the NOESY in place of the TOCSY. Peak-pick the NOESY spectrum and
merge the NOESY peak table with the TOCY peak data-base (<b>Copy the db from
another data-set</b> and <b>Merge the peak table into the db</b> commands)
<li>	use the NH-NH region and the NH-Ha region to do the sequential assignment,
use the marker tool again to create new NOESY peaks in the data-base. Check
peaks and spins with the <b>find peak </b>and <b>find spin </b>tools, use
<b>edit peak </b>to add peaks in the NOESY data base.
<li>	once a sequential is found, modify the spin systems accordingly
<li>	go back to 9 as long as the sequential is not finished
<li>	assign all remaining NOESY peaks.
<li>	output the NOESY peaks in the form of a constraint file (see
<i>Integration</i> menu).</ol>Thirteen steps, not such a big deal after all
!<br>
You will notice that the program slows down when the data-base get bigger, this
is why it is not recommended to start with a big peak-picking, and then to
handle a big data-base throughout the whole process.</p>

<h2>
<A NAME="Heading99">Qualitative or quantitative intensity analysis</A></h2>

<p>
  The intensity analysis (<i>Integration</i>) menu implements a set of simple
tools dedicated to the analysis of peak intensity according to the assignment
database. Here is a simple 'recipe' on how to use this menu:<br>
 If you want to produce a constraint file used for structure generation:<ol>
<li>	Determine intensities of database peaks using the command <b>Single
data-set integration tool</b>. 
<li>	Determine a set of calibration peaks, which will be used to define
distance estimates on the current peak of the database  (see command <b>Choose
the calibration intensities</b> above). This set of peaks contains the
calibration distances chosen for a series of peaks, for which the corresponding
intensities are contained in the database.
<li>	Write the output constraint file, according to the set of calibration
peaks. The file can be written in XPLOR or DYANA format, and the distance
estimates can be generated in the 'build_up' or 'qualitative' ways. 'Build-up'
way means that a precise distance estimate is quantitatively determined from
the information contained in the peak calibration set. Then, a general
uncertainty can be supposed for all the distances.</ol>   If you want to
generate files containing intensity variation on a series of data-sets (in the
case you want to perform quantitative T1, T2 or nOe analysis).<ol>
<li>	Copy the database to an ascii peak file (same format than those used in
pkread/pkwrite commands), and save the lookup table giving the peak index in
function of the database index (<b>Copy db to a pk file)</b>.
<li>	Then read this peak file (<b>PkRead</b>) and integrate it using the amoeba
procedure. Save the amoeba file using the same basename than the peak file.
<li>	Finally, perform a multiple integration of the series of data-sets
according to the saved amoeba file, using the <b>Multiple Integration Tool</b>.
For each peak in the database, an intensity file is generated and you can check
it by using the <b>Show Integration Curve</b> command.</ol></p>

<h2>
<A NAME="Heading100">Heteronuclear Relaxation analysis</A></h2>

<p>
  The Dynamic analysis (<i>Dynamic</i> ) menu implements a set of simple tools
dedicated to the analysis of heteronuclear relaxation. Here is a simple
'recipe' on how to use this menu:<ol>
<li>	Get a set of 2D relaxation experiments, in the same acquisition and
processing conditions (be carefull with ppm calibration)
<li>	Fill up the assignment database for all the peak you want to analyse.
<li>	Set up the dataset list file, which determine which experiments should be
used, and what are the experimental parameters
<li>	Try to process one peak to check if everything is correct.
<li>	zoom on the region you want to process and start the integration tool.
<li>	Once the integration is finished, start the parameter estimate.
<li>	You may finally want to check if every thing is correct by running the
Monte-Carlo tool. This one is currently very slow, so may choose to write a
batch file and start it off-graphic with the following command issued in the
project directory :</ol></p>
