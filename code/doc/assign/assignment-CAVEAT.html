CAVEAT</H1>
<p>	Note that this is a preliminary work, quite a few people have been using
this tool here in our lab, however, I'm sure there is still a lot of bugs.<ul>
<li>	There ARE known bugs, for instance deleting spin-systems might, in certain
cases, let the data-base within wrong incoherent informations (however version
1.2 is much more robust than previous ones). Use the <tt>check database</tt>
command. In this case, the best way of doing is probably to modify directly the
wrong entries. Note that the command Low level editor permits a direct editing
to each peak, spin and system, and can be helpful in debugging the data-bases.
You can also modify entries from the Gifa command-line level (print $att[xx]
set att[xxx] = "---" ).  In desesperate case, you might want to use perl to
access directly the db files.
<li>	There are things that will change. For instance the LARGEST entry, being
numerical, interferes with the FIND mechanism. This will change, probably, the
LARGEST entry will be prefixed with some non numerical char.
<li>	There are missing tools. To cite the most likely to come first : 'edit
build list' ...
<li>	An integration tool based on the line-fitter commands is missing.
<li>	Because of a bug in some dbm namagers (Not in Linux, but most other UNIX
implementation), it is not possible to use the foreach syntaxe for modifying
entries in the data-bases. So, you cannot use the following:</ul></p>

<pre>
foreach i in att
  if ($i s! "LARGEST") then
     set att[i] = "what you want"
  endif 
endfor
</pre>
<p>Rather
use the following:</p>

<pre>
for i = 1 to $att["LARGEST"]
  if (exist('att['//$i//']')) then
     set att[i] = "what you want"
  endif 
endfor
</pre>
