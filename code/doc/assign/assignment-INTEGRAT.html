<h2>
<A NAME="Heading71">Integration menu</A></h2>

<p>This
menu allows the calculation of peak intensites, and the output of distance
constraint files or peak intensity curve.</p>

<h3>
<A NAME="Heading72">Help (short)</A></h3>

<p>Produces
a short help of the Integration manu as a 'recipe' to use this menu. The
complete assignment help contained in the HTML documentation can be called from
this short help.</p>

<h3>
<A NAME="Heading73">Single data-set integration tool</A></h3>

<p>Performs
integration of all the peaks of the opened dbm assignment table (it is not
possible to perform this integration only on the current zoom window, because
of a bug in dbm described in CAVEAT). The calulated volumes are put into the
dbm dbm amplitude Different integration methods can be used: 'Max in box' gives
the data-set value at the peak maximum (located within the integration box),
'sumrec' and 'amoeba' make use of the commands SUMREC and INTEG respectively.</p>

<h3>
<A NAME="Heading74">Write build-up constraints file</A></h3>

<p>From
the calibration peak set, the program determines by a least-square method a
proportionality coefficient between intensity values and the inverse sixth
power of the distance. this coefficient is then used to associate a distance to
each element of the peak data-base. Then, using the uncertainty on the distance
provided the user, it write a constraint file with distance upper and lower
bounds. The file format can be 
<a TARGET="_top" href="http://xplor.csb.yale.edu/">XPLOR</a>
or 
<a TARGET="_top" href="http://www.mol.biol.ethz.ch/wuthrich/software/dyana/">DYANA</a>
format.</p>

<h3>
<A NAME="Heading75">Write qualitative constraints file</A></h3>

<p>From
the calibration peak set, the program determines by a least-square method a
proportionality coefficient between intensity values and the inverse sixth
power of the distance. this coefficient is then used to associate a distance to
each element of the peak data-base. Then, using distance interval and upper and
lower bounds given for each interval by the user, it write a constraint file
with distance upper and lower bounds. The file format can be 
<a TARGET="_top" href="http://xplor.csb.yale.edu/">XPLOR</a>
or 
<a TARGET="_top" href="http://www.mol.biol.ethz.ch/wuthrich/software/dyana/">DYANA</a>
format.</p>

<h3>
<A NAME="Heading76">Copy db to a peak file</A></h3>

<p>Copy
the current assignment data-base to a peak file that can be read with PKREAD,
and create a lookup database giving the relation between the peak index in the
assignment data-base and in the peak file. The peak file name is basename.atr
and the lookup file names are: basename.hash.dir and basename.hash.pag.</p>

<h3>
<A NAME="Heading77">Read peak file</A></h3>

<p>Reads
a peak file with the command 
<a TARGET="_top" href="../Pcommands.html#PKREAD">PKREAD</a>.</p>

<h3>
<A NAME="Heading78">PkList</A></h3>

<p>Lists
the peak table (see command 
<a TARGET="_top" href="../Pcommands.html#PKLIST">PKLIST</a>).</p>

<h3>
<A NAME="Heading79">ShowPeaks</A></h3>

<p>Displays
the peaks located in the current zoom window (see command 
<a TARGET="_top" href="../Scommands.html#SHOWPEAKS">SHOWPEAKS</a>).</p>

<h3>
<A NAME="Heading80">Eval noise</A></h3>

<p>Evaluates
the noise on the data-sets using a zoom window given by the user.</p>

<h3>
<A NAME="Heading81">Integ</A></h3>

<p>Performs
the peak integration according to the noise level and the peak table, by
calculating for each peak an amoeba (see command 
<a TARGET="_top" href="../Icommands.html#INTEG">INTEG</a>).</p>

<h3>
<A NAME="Heading82">Show Amoeba</A></h3>

<p>Show
on the disp2d window the amoeba located in the current zoom window (see command 
<a TARGET="_top" href="../Scommands.html#SHOW">SHOW</a>)..</p>

<h3>
<A NAME="Heading83">Modify Amoeba</A></h3>

<p>After
selecting this command, the program will ask you to click on a peak, and will
create a formbox, which permits to interactively and graphically modify the
peak amoeba by selecting one-by-one pixels. Two possibilities are available:
"add" adds the selected pixel to the peak amoeba, "erase" removes the selected
pixel from the peak amoeba.<br>
If the flag is set-up to 'add' and the pixel is in another peak amoeba, the
program ask to user to take a decision.</p>

<h3>
<A NAME="Heading84">Read Peaks/Amoeba</A></h3>

<p>Reads
a peak file and an amoeba file according to a basename given by the user. The
peak file name is: basename.pek, and the amoeba file name is: basename.amb</p>

<h3>
<A NAME="Heading85">Save Peaks/Amoeba</A></h3>

<p>Saves
the current peak table and the current amoeba to a peak file and to an amoeba
file according to a basename given by the user. The peak file name is:
basename.pek, and the amoeba file name is: basename.amb. If the peaks/amoeba
files already exist with the same basename, the user is asked to remove them.</p>

<h3>
<A NAME="Heading86">Multiple integration tool</A></h3>

<p>Permits
the integration of peaks along a series of experiments according to an
assignment database, an amoeba file and the project list of spectra. For each
peak, the integral values are written in  an independent file, located in the
<i>processing</i> directory. Two formats are possible: free ascii format or 
<a TARGET="_top" href="http://sumppu.fmi.fi/prog/tela.html">Tela</a>
macro format. The user can select in the formbox the spectra he want to be used
in the integration.<br>
To perform the multiple integration of peaks, the amoeba basename file should
be the same than the basename of the lookup data-base between the indexes of
peaks in assignment data-base and peak file (see the command <b>Copy db to a
peak file</b> above).</p>

<h3>
<A NAME="Heading87">Show integration curve</A></h3>

<p>Permits
the display of the curve obtained with the multiple integration utility, by
clicking on the corresponding peak.</p>

<h3>
<A NAME="Heading88">Peak movie</A></h3>

<p>After
selecting this command, the program ask to you to click on a peak, and then
creates a formbox, which allows to display successively the selected peak on
the list of project spectra. The user can select in the list the spectra to be
displayed.
