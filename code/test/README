This a test directory for Gifa.
 
The macro TEST does all the work (tests to be done are in TEST_LIST)
Some tests will need the data directory to be there.
 
To use it, you can either :
- start Gifa from within this directory, tests will start by themself
- start Gifa elsewhere, cd to this directory, type TEST.
 
Note that all functionalities of Gifa are not tested !
(Note also that this file is used for the test File I/O test, so the blank lines should
contain at least one blank)
