# This file is used for customizing the layout of the
# navigation panels created by rtftoweb. You can tell rtftoweb to load
# a customization file like this one by the command line option "-N <file>".
# If the file "nav-panel" exists in rtftohtml's library directory and no
# -N option was given the navigation panel layout will be read from that file.
#
# Each of the following lines define a certain panel element. Everything that 
# follows the first colon will be literally inserted into the html files.
# This way it is possible to have inline images as navigation buttons.
#

# these define the buttons of the navigation panels:
previous.:<IMG SRC="leftg.gif" ALT="Prev " border=0>
next.....:<IMG SRC="rightg.gif" ALT="Next " border=0>
up.......:<IMG SRC="upg.gif" ALT="Up " border=0>
title....:<IMG SRC="upg.gif" ALT="Title " border=0>
contents.:<IMG SRC="contg.gif" ALT="Contents " border=0>
index....:<IMG SRC="indexg.gif" ALT="Index" border=0>

# the following maybe specified to display, say, a "previous" button, even if
# there is no previous document (so that the nav panel always looks the same):
#noprev...:<IMG SRC="noleftg.gif" ALT=".... " border=0>
#nonext...:<IMG SRC="norightg.gif" ALT=".... " border=0>
#noup.....:<IMG SRC="noupg.gif" ALT=".. " border=0>
#notitle..:<IMG SRC="noupg.gif" ALT="..... " border=0>

# the delimiter between navigation items:
delimiter: 

# definition for the horizontal line:
hr.......:<hr size=4>

#
# The following lines specify additional document options to date only
# supported by Netscape.
