# *Gifa* v4 program - an effort to revive the program.

This is a repository of the historic NMR processing program *Gifa v4* as published in:

Jean-Luc Pons, Thérèse E. Malliavin, Marc A. Delsuc Gifa V. 4: A complete package for NMR data set processing.

The first commits are as follows:
- initial:  source files, macros, and tests of the 4.31 version - dated 1st Aug 2000 - the older source I could find (nearly 20 years later !)
- then: same set-up version 4.41 1 Jan 2002
